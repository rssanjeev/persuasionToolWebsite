t3_2ybbix,"so, i think the main problem with what you are arguing in your post is that you have said ""most"" arguments that boil down to protecting children are wrong. you go on to list a few of the offenders: > argument against gay marriage - ""we can't legalize gay marriage, think of the children, how am i going to explain that to my child?"" argument against sex education - ""we can't teach kids sex ed, it will ruin their innocence, we have to protect the children!"" argument against legalizing drugs - ""if we legalize drugs, more kids will do drugs. think of the children!"" argument for censoring television - ""if we show boobs on television, kids will see them for some reason that's terrible!"" can't opposite views be expressed, still using ""for the children"" arguments? for example: argument for gay marriage: ""we need to legalize gay marriage. otherwise, gay children will grow up with a major part of their identities legally marginalized. think of the children! argument for sex education: ""we have to teach kids sex ed or else they will enter their teenage years with little to no understanding of the dangers of stds or the possibilities of pregnancy. they will have unsafe sex, and they will feel confused and lost rather than understanding that their own burgeoning sexuality is normal and healthy. think of the children! etc. so, it seems like the issue is not the ""for the children!"" part of these arguments at all. your problem is really with the actual substance of the arguments. justifying a political argument by talking about children's' well-being and safety does not make the argument itself right or wrong. i think we all agree that human well-being and safety--including that of children--is a reasonable basis for political decisions. it seems to me that the issue you take is with people using ""for the children"" claims to cover up their weak underlying reasoning. if they can show that something really will substantively harm children (and that that harm is a stronger concern that other outcomes of a political choice), maybe they have a point; if they are yelling about the poor children, but you simply disagree that whatever they are railing about (gay marriage, sex ed, legalized drugs) will truly be harmful, then their argument is weak. so, your original premise that ""most political arguments that boil down to 'we must protect the children' are bad arguments"" is not really correct. rather, you seem like you are really arguing is ""arguments that rely on the emotional pull of 'we must protect the children' in order to cover up practical considerations or weak justification are mostly wrong."" or else something like ""arguments that lean on protecting children without considering other possible outcomes and results to all members of the population are weak.""",cp82nwy,1380.1406622105353,1,1425818499,41,8,24946,0,56.482787356321836,464.0,717.0,24.0,1,0.125,0.041666666666666664,0.16666666666666666,0.16666666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.0,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.0,0.6249999999999999,0.1283250565859262,0.21982758620689655,0.0,0,0.0,468,68.70,90.73,18.40,1.00,19.50,25.43,94.23,53.21,14.32,8.33,1.07,2.14,2.14,0.00,2.99,5.98,6.41,14.32,9.19,4.27,4.91,1.71,14.74,6.84,1.71,0.64,0.00,2.14,11.32,2.14,9.19,0.21,4.49,0.43,19.02,1.28,0.00,0.00,0.00,17.74,4.49,2.78,2.35,4.91,1.50,7.05,1.50,0.85,0.43,0.21,5.77,0.21,2.14,3.42,0.21,15.60,3.42,0.21,8.33,0.21,3.42,0.43,10.90,2.35,5.34,1.07,3.21,0.64,2.99,0.64,0.00,0.21,0.00,0.00,0.85,0.21,0.00,0.21,0.43,0.00,20.51,3.42,3.85,0.85,0.21,0.43,1.28,2.14,5.13,2.14,0.85,0.21

t3_317c4q,"what *exactly* do you think was the problem with the maginot line? i think there are cases pro- and con-cancelling the program, but you are basing your judgment entirely on an analogy, the substance of which is not at all clear. for example, just to suggest some of the complications: there are at least three different versions you can give of ""why the maginot line was a very bad thing"". one was that it only covered one section of the frontier, and it should have been extended to the channel. a second was that it committed the french strategically to defending a particular line, when they should have had a doctrine of maneuver. a third was that, as a matter of budget priorities, the maginot line was the least effective asset, franc for franc, in the french arsenal. each of these suggests a possible critique of the f-35 program, but a very specific critique. and it is not clear that your details defend any version of the analogy. by the way, with respect to your thoughts on the f-35 vs drones, you might enjoy geschenkeron's *economic backwardness in comparative perspective.* the tl;dr version is that for all large society-level investments, the point at which fixed-costs investment in a new project begin, the point at which they begin to start paying off, and the point at which the benefits have justified the initial investment, are spaced out in time such that countries and regions tend to leapfrog each other technologically; for example, the cities with the first subways and highways were rich, forward-looking cities, but then when a second-generation of subway/highway technology and techniques became available (partly because of experimentation during the first generation!) these cities were already committed to old subways and could not justify replacing them yet. so the point is that *observing* that a project which has a large initial investment becomes out-of-date just a year after you start the initial investment, and becomes more and more out-of-date (relative to new projects) as time goes on proves nothing. if you canceled the f35 to start a new project, ... well, by the time that project got under way, it would be outdated too.",cpz4dkk,234.8725514195858,1,1428028379,124,21,9545,0,49.12906593406595,364.0,565.0,14.0,23,0.0,0.0,0.2857142857142857,0.35714285714285715,0.07142857142857142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14285714285714285,0.0,0.0,0.14285714285714285,0.0,0.9999999999999998,0.07718851197112066,0.25,0.0,0,0.0,377,88.83,60.47,56.73,30.24,29.00,24.40,84.35,53.58,9.81,3.45,0.27,0.00,2.39,0.00,0.80,6.37,11.67,14.06,8.49,4.24,5.57,1.06,12.47,5.04,2.65,2.39,2.65,3.45,2.39,1.33,1.06,0.00,0.00,0.00,4.77,0.00,0.53,0.00,0.00,12.20,3.18,1.33,1.59,1.59,2.92,3.18,0.80,0.80,0.00,0.00,0.27,0.00,0.27,0.00,0.00,3.98,0.00,0.80,1.59,0.53,1.06,3.45,7.16,0.53,16.98,1.06,8.49,7.96,3.98,0.27,0.00,3.18,0.00,0.00,0.27,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.27,0.00,18.04,3.71,6.10,0.27,0.53,0.27,0.27,3.18,0.53,0.27,1.06,1.86

t3_2zdsjs,"i am surprised the environmental devastation our 'greatness' has driven has not been mentioned beyond global warming. technology is indeed exponential, but so is the destruction of the planet's resources. diverse species are perhaps the most amazing fruit of the earth, but when they are lost, they are irretrievable - even with scientific achievements like trying to revive wooly mammoths, the vast majority of extinctions are permanent loss of biodiversity on our planet. there are a host of environmental issues to consider: deforestation, waterway pollution, ocean gyres, vast overfishing, and climate change. i personally focus on loss of biodiversity. i believe that any of these problems becomes catastrophic once it leads or contributes to the permanent loss of species. indeed, while anthropogenic climate change is a serious issue for human beings, thousands upon thousands of species far less equipped to deal with change than us will (and may already) be negatively affected. by all accounts, it is not possible to know what we are losing, because we scarcely even know whats out there. here are some facts from the [world wildlife fund](* the rapid loss of species we are seeing today is estimated by experts to be between 1,000 and 10,000 times higher than the natural extinction rate. * these experts calculate that between 0.01 and 0.1% of all species will become extinct each year. * if the low estimate of the number of species out there is true - i.e. that there are around 2 million different species on our planet** - then that means between 200 and 2,000 extinctions occur every year. * but if the upper estimate of species numbers is true - that there are 100 million different species co-existing with us on our planet - then between 10,000 and 100,000 species are becoming extinct each year. i have a dilemma; i want to maintain your rosy perspective on human achievement and potential, but i do want to change your view that the future is overwhelmingly positive without *lots and lots of work*. work that very well may not happen, leaving us with a less hospitable, and irrecoverably less diverse natural world. a very scary part of all this is that the incredible economy you talked about, often fueled by exploitation and war, is the driver of a huge amount of the activity which creates so many of these problems. but the social side of environmental issues is a whole other can of worms, one that touches on the fact that the vast majority of humanity is not achieving any version of the comfort and security of the most developed nations, and that the global cultural paradigm is not set up for an 'everyone wins' system - exploitation is, at a very deep level, built in. there is no evidence that this is in any way driving us towards an enlightened social future in regard to economic justice for most people around the world. not that there are not social movements that are exciting, but money and power have a bit of a vice grip on society, and the pyramid scheme has worked out well for those few at the top for a long time. a bigger room at the top of the pyramid is not, in my book, human progress, especially when it is contingent on little paid or unpaid labor at the bottom. oof, sorry for the social rant. back to the environment. if you want just one small but detailed slice of the biodiversity issue, check out the documentary 'the end of the line' about overfishing in our oceans. it touches on how in such a ""great"" human civilization may manage to completely devastate our oceans for generations. **tl;dr**: there is not much greatness in one species affecting a mass extinction of the scale we are currently seeing. it is so bad, that the current era is being labeled the ['anthropocene'](and is largely characterized by drastic loss in biodiversity - which without us would have increased exponentially. it is hypothesized that we have created the sixth mass extinction of planet earth, and despite international efforts it is only getting worse. *edit: added tldr.* *edit 2: formatting!*",cpiftnl,331.53958678674235,1,1426653172,115,12,29625,0,49.429821428571444,672.0,1081.0,32.0,1,0.0,0.0,0.25,0.5625,0.0,0.03125,0.0,0.03125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09375,0.0,0.96875,0.06316658252142122,0.27380952380952384,0.0,0,0.0,692,79.51,54.60,44.91,19.31,25.63,23.55,81.79,51.45,9.39,4.34,1.01,2.31,0.58,0.14,0.29,5.06,7.80,14.45,8.96,5.49,5.49,1.88,12.28,5.78,2.46,0.87,3.61,4.05,5.35,2.46,2.89,0.29,0.29,1.73,5.49,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.14,13.15,1.59,1.59,1.30,3.47,2.02,4.34,1.16,0.43,0.00,0.58,0.29,0.00,0.14,0.00,0.14,10.40,2.89,3.47,3.18,1.30,1.59,1.30,9.83,1.45,14.74,1.59,9.83,3.47,2.60,0.14,0.14,0.87,0.00,0.14,0.72,0.00,0.14,0.29,0.29,0.00,16.62,4.19,5.06,0.58,0.29,0.00,0.14,1.16,0.29,1.30,0.58,3.03
t3_35007e,"your argument may be true in first or second generation democracies where there are still aftershocks of the transition from a harsher form of government, but it sends entirely the wrong message in established democracies. in a real democracy, peacefully handing over power is the absolute baseline expectation, you do not get any reward for doing it. to start seeing it as a favor the president does to his successor is to poison the system. second, i know presidents are often ""commander in chief"" and have some control over the military, but they do not have the power to be tyrants. they are not above all law, and do not have legal power once their term expires. an elected president in an actual democracy could not just mobilize the army and keep themselves permanently in power. also the checks and balances of a democracy are supposed to keep leaders from doing things they would be prosecuted for. prosecuting leaders who cross the line is part of how we send the message that ""these things are not ok from our leaders."" finally, consider what behavior you incentivize by granting full immunity for departing leaders: they have literally no reason not to be as vicious as possible while in office, including doing terrible things to stay in office, because they will receive a full pardon. it is why it is so important that international courts start prosecuting dictators and warlords. egypt is a really bad example of a democracy, considering mubarak was president for 30 years by winning races in which he was the only candidate, and he had a habit of imprisoning dissidents without trial. he was ousted by violent revolution, which generally is unnecessary in true democracies. in egypt's case it might be worth granting pardons in the name of peace, but that was not a case of a democratic handover of power.",cqzpsh4,363.94526018454883,1,1430877109,50,14,4404,0,45.00000000000003,312.0,507.0,13.0,8,0.07692307692307693,0.0,0.3076923076923077,0.3076923076923077,0.0,0.07692307692307693,0.0,0.07692307692307693,0.07692307692307693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07692307692307693,0.07692307692307693,1.0769230769230766,0.1147186147186147,0.30128205128205127,0.0,0,0.0,313,69.35,61.33,17.25,37.06,24.08,25.24,82.43,56.55,10.86,5.43,0.32,0.64,0.96,1.28,2.24,5.43,7.99,14.70,12.14,4.15,5.75,3.19,16.61,3.51,0.96,2.24,1.60,1.60,5.11,2.88,2.24,0.00,1.28,0.00,9.27,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.28,12.14,1.28,1.60,0.96,2.88,1.60,4.47,0.32,0.32,0.00,0.00,0.64,0.00,0.64,0.00,0.00,11.50,1.28,2.24,8.63,0.96,0.64,1.92,11.18,1.28,11.50,1.92,6.39,3.83,4.15,0.00,0.00,0.32,0.00,0.00,0.32,0.00,0.00,0.32,0.00,0.00,10.22,4.15,4.15,0.32,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.28,0.32,0.00,0.00

t3_3faz00,"i am a high-school math teacher, and this debate could really use some context. the issue you are raising is actually a very well-known one in mathematics education: the *acceleration* vs. *enrichment* debate. for a long time, the consensus among math education specialists and math teachers (at least, the ones who pay attention to these issues and give a shit) was that, all else being equal, **enrichment is much better than acceleration** in terms of pure pedagogical value. enrichment is frankly just better teaching. a quality math education should include an in-depth treatment of mathematical concepts, as well as building fluency in key mathematical procedures, and ideally should also include discussion of the historical and scientific contexts in which these concepts were developed. the reason that acceleration is so much more common is that enrichment much more resource-intensive to provide, since it requires (1) developing new curriculum, and (2) hiring teachers with enough mathematical savvy to actually go beyond the book and cover topics in depth. **increasingly, though some have started challenging this consensus.** in the old way of thinking, some students were ""good"" at math and some students were ""bad"" at math, and there was little that teachers could do to move students from one category to another. you do not say so directly, but i gather from some of your statements that you hold similar assumptions. but these assumptions are not really borne out by cognitive science. rather, mathematical skills are essentially ""mental muscles"" that will grow and improve with frequent practice. i am not claiming that there are no innate differences in ability-- clearly, not everyone can be [terence tao](and certainly some people are going to require more work and effort to get to the same place than others. but high school math is not exactly rocket science, and the best evidence we have right now suggests that *all students* can eventually master math at least to the point of algebra 2-- and more importantly, they can master it *conceptually,* rather than purely by rote. **looked at in that light, acceleration starts to make a lot more sense;** not as a replacement for enrichment but as a supplement. the idea now is that all students should receive the kind of rich, conceptual mathematical training that you are describing, at a pace that matches their abilities. in fact, there is good evidence that this kind of teaching is actually *better* for weaker students, who will remember new mathematical ideas much better if they have well-understood concepts to ""anchor"" those ideas to (these can be either previous math concepts, like anchoring trigonometry to similar triangles, or to concepts from outside of math, like anchoring exponential growth to personal banking). **the problem with this kind of teaching with weaker students,** i can say from experience, **is that it takes a long time.** some kids will be able to see these concepts once or twice and they make sense immediately; others will need a lot more repetition, practice, or to see these ideas in other contexts before it ""clicks."" that's where the acceleration comes in-- stronger students do not need to be ""held back"" while their peers are still mastering material at their own pace. i have even seen a few schools where some students take 2 years to do algebra 1 instead of 1 year, and this is part of the design of the curriculum. in my opinion, this is not a bad thing at all-- better to learn the basics very thoroughly than to race through material without ever really understanding it. these students may not make it to calculus, but they will have a very deep and solid understanding of the mathematics used in, for example, personal finance or civics, as well as a broader appreciation for what it is that mathematicians actually *do.* now, this may never become as widespread in the u.s. as we might like, essentially for two reasons: 1) the resource constraints mentioned above, and 2) there just are not enough math teachers out there with sufficient mathematical training to teach in this way. but many individual schools (and even some individual districts) are trying it out nonetheless, and having pretty good success. as a final note, i want to **correct a few small factual errors** in your post about the way education policy works in the united states: * education in the u.s. is extremely decentralized compared to other first-world countries. there is no true national curriculum, and there likely never will be. almost all major education policies are made at the state level, or in many cases the school district level. common core is changing this a little bit, but especially in high school math lots of implementation decisions were deliberately left to the individual states and districts, to avoid even the appearance of federal encroachment on states' rights. * there is no ""national placement test,"" and decisions about accelerating students are typically made at the district or even the individual school level. where i grew up, in oregon, i was able to take algebra 1 as a 6th grader and continue from there; where i now teach in new york state, it is almost impossible to take algebra 1 earlier than 8th grade because of the structure of the mandatory state regents exams. * the curriculum sequence you describe of algebra -> geometry -> algebra 2 -> calculus is not universal. some include a mandatory or optional year of discrete math or pre-calculus; some (such as minnesota) use a course called ""fst"" (functions, statistics, and trigonometry) as a fourth-year math course; others use an integrated curriculum, where instead of topical courses you take integrated math 1, integrated math 2, etc., which includes a mix of algebra, geometry, and other areas. * you may be overestimating the amount of control teachers have over their own classrooms. i think many teachers would tell you they agree with most of this, but find it impossible to do realistically because of pressures from high stakes tests and/or inflexible administrators. in new york, for example, some teachers may risk losing their jobs if students specifically in the lowest third of the class do not do well enough on the state regents exams; given this situation, it makes sense that teachers would not focus on the high-level students as much.",ctn4gf4,2534.9743701267203,1,1438373248,34,9,-14363,0,44.90280310721792,1033.0,1665.0,41.0,3,0.07317073170731707,0.0,0.3170731707317073,0.6829268292682927,0.0,0.024390243902439025,0.024390243902439025,0.07317073170731707,0.0,0.04878048780487805,0.04878048780487805,0.0,0.04878048780487805,0.0,1.3414634146341466,NaN,0.24491771539206195,0.0,0,0.0,1053,74.02,38.04,48.02,52.49,32.91,24.98,85.19,49.29,8.93,3.13,1.04,0.19,0.95,0.00,0.95,5.79,5.98,14.06,8.17,6.36,6.27,1.80,12.63,7.03,4.75,0.95,1.99,4.27,3.70,2.47,1.04,0.28,0.09,0.19,4.37,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,16.24,2.66,1.61,1.71,4.27,2.18,5.60,1.33,0.66,0.28,0.00,0.38,0.19,0.28,0.00,0.00,9.02,0.28,2.18,5.32,1.52,0.57,2.09,9.88,1.23,13.11,1.04,8.36,3.61,10.64,0.09,0.00,0.38,0.00,0.00,0.57,0.09,0.00,0.09,0.38,0.00,20.13,3.89,5.79,0.28,0.57,0.00,0.00,1.90,1.52,0.19,1.61,4.37

t3_3f8yj7,"so leaving aside the whiggish narrative of history in the first half of your post being wrong (states do not always go from decentralized to centralized in a nice linear fashion), there is a lot of reasons why a unified europe remains, at best, a pipe dream. first, the economic angle. the economies of europe are vastly different in output. germany is an economic powerhouse. greece can't pay its debts. most of the rest are somewhere in the middle. so you would need all these disparate economies to agree to pay their share of taxes, which will inevitably be unequal, as will who reaps the benefits. germany is already unhappy about how badly they have been burnt down in greece. imagine if that was a yearly occurrence. the second issue, you touched on yourself. compatibility. in east europe, you have countries like poland who get very nervous when people start talking about doing things to their national sovereignty. in west europe, you have got hatreds that run back hundreds of years. in the balkans, i am sure the slavs will jump at the chance for another unified government, and the greeks and the turks will have no issues at all being in the same ""country"". finally a large unified government is going to be a bureaucratic nightmare. first, you will encounter the west lothian question writ large. are the germans going to let greeks have an equal say in how this hypothetical government's money is spent? how about the french? are the irish going to be happy haggling over a budget with the english? will the spainards be likely to listen to the finns when it comes down to how to divvy up the tax? the balkans alone would be an absolute fucking nightmare. second, you are going to have to find a way to nail all the various forms of government in europe together into something every other country is happy with. what do you do with the british monarchy, for instance? at election time, how are you going to convince portugal to accept votes from romania (whose ballet boxes may or may not be stuffed). at least you have interpol for cops, but how are you building a military here? an intelligence agency? and then you have to hold it together. a single major economic crisis was enough to threaten the eu, and if this thing disintegrates, the consequences will be much, much worse. and all these are internal issues. they ignore the international side (how does russia react? what about china?) of things. unifying europe into one central government is a morass of issues. if it happens, it will happen very, very slowly, with large amounts of not entirely unjustified resistance.",ctmi79z,221.06861145062982,1,1438325845,31,10,7300,0,64.33198497019953,454.0,692.0,34.0,1,0.0,0.0,0.029411764705882353,0.11764705882352941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029411764705882353,0.0,0.029411764705882353,0.0,0.0,0.029411764705882353,0.029411764705882353,0.2647058823529412,0.005785123966942149,0.31938325991189426,0.0,0,0.0,454,80.24,69.38,35.20,22.36,13.35,20.26,83.70,53.74,9.25,3.96,0.22,0.00,2.86,0.00,0.88,5.07,9.69,14.76,11.89,5.73,5.07,1.10,16.96,4.85,2.42,3.52,1.98,3.52,4.63,2.20,2.42,0.44,0.44,0.44,6.17,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,10.79,1.32,2.42,1.32,3.08,2.20,2.42,0.88,0.00,0.44,0.44,0.22,0.00,0.00,0.22,0.00,7.05,0.66,0.88,4.19,0.88,1.10,1.32,11.23,3.52,16.08,2.42,10.13,3.74,3.74,0.44,0.00,2.86,0.00,0.00,0.44,0.22,0.00,0.22,0.00,0.00,14.54,5.51,4.85,0.00,0.00,1.98,0.00,0.00,0.44,0.44,1.32,0.00

look it up. multiple recent court decisions defend an officer's wish to do whatever he wants with your things. civil forfeiture does require cause and a hearing in court. there are well recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement and if anything, court decisions are breaking against the state. vehicle tracking devices and cell phone searches being chief among them. see: united states v jones and riley v california. if you have other cases in mind that support your point, please cite them. >cops can arrest you on the spot for literally anything they see fit, and you will be held -at least- until your bail hearing, and you will be lucky if you can afford your bail. also, they can compel you through whatever means they see fit (lying, threatening, depriving of basic needs, torture) to bear testimony against yourself, even if you are innocent (any testimony given under duress is admissible to the court, and usually leads to conviction regardless of proof-of-guilt). also, they fund their own departments by issuing citations and stealing property (seriously, if you have not looked up civil forfeiture, do it now). police officers are only legally authorized to execute an arrest if there has been a warrant issued or they have reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed and this person committed it. the bail hearing, or arraignment, typically happens within 24-48 hours of the arrest. the judge will hear about the facts and circumstances surrounding the arrest and has the power to set the defendant free if the state cannot produce sufficient evidence justifying the arrest. then, this addresses your next section as well, sets bail. if bail is unreasonably high for the defendant, it can be reduced and commonly is. judges do not want to keep people locked up if they do not have to, at least for the most part. state judges are elected officials after all. the bottom line is that cops and prosecutors do not have the time or resources to make bad arrests or bring bad cases to a jury. that's why most arrests are the result of a long investigative process where the evidence is in place and a judge signs an arrest warrant. cops making an arrest on the street is usually because the crime happens right in front of them or several people tell them person a was running from the store that was just robbed. the true bottom line is that you are failing victim to the media you seem to want to warn everyone else about. across the us, crime is at historically low levels and getting lower. internationally, there are fewer wars involving less people than at any other time in world history. the modern media spends a inordinate amount of time reporting on violence and war that makes it seem like nothing else is going on. yes, this year, 2015, has featured several national news stories involving allegations of police misconduct that resulted in people dying. they are all tragedies and i hope that police departments across the country learn from the mistakes made in those situations. what almost never gets reported is the boring, routine, everyday police work that accounts for 99% of the police/public interactions. such stories do not sell. yes there is abuse in the system. it is hopefully routed out and eliminated. this idea that we are going to someday find ourselves in a perfect world is a pipe dream. so to answer your final set of questions, yes, you are delusional. that's because you likely consume mostly main stream news media that lives and breathes on sensationalism. your information has not been shared with us, however, so this is just my best guess. citizens are safer now than we have ever been, violent crime is [down](",ct431zw,4561.18644072404,1,1436968899,269,35,-19892,0,59.00984913793107,870.0,1331.0,48.0,20,0.08333333333333333,0.020833333333333332,0.020833333333333332,0.3125,0.0,0.0,0.020833333333333332,0.0,0.0625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.020833333333333332,0.5833333333333333,NaN,0.27241379310344827,0.0,0,0.0,878,56.79,75.65,28.84,3.27,17.92,20.73,84.97,52.73,12.53,7.29,0.68,0.68,3.64,0.11,2.16,5.24,6.49,11.96,10.25,4.78,6.72,2.28,16.06,4.10,2.16,1.37,0.80,2.16,6.49,2.05,4.44,0.34,2.16,0.57,10.93,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.11,15.72,2.96,2.28,2.62,5.13,1.59,5.35,2.16,0.91,1.03,0.11,0.46,0.23,0.11,0.11,0.00,8.66,1.03,0.57,5.58,0.91,1.25,1.37,13.44,1.48,11.39,1.03,7.06,3.19,2.85,0.34,0.11,0.91,0.00,0.68,0.68,0.00,0.00,0.46,0.23,0.00,13.55,5.35,4.90,0.11,0.00,0.11,0.00,0.68,0.23,0.34,1.03,0.80

[that eventually got whittled down to thirty-one when they eliminated the false-positives.](and of those 31, two of them were the sort of fraud that voter id laws would potentially prevent. #**3. how often voter id laws disenfranchise legitimate voters** there are a lot of citizens out there who do not have a driver's license. as many as 7% of the country, according to the [brennan center for justice](who did some polling on the matter. 7% of the country translates to 13 million people. what sort of people are not likely to have valid photo id with their current name and address on it? 1) poor people and minorities. a lot of people who can't afford a car will not bother getting a license. 2) college students. when i was in college, i was registered to vote in my college town, but my license still said (and, in fact, still does say--i need to get that fixed) my parents' address. 3) women. women who've gotten married fairly recently will often still have their maiden name on their license, because who wants to deal with the dmv if you do not absolutely have to. 4) old people. too blind or enfeebled to drive a car, so why bother renewing your license? other than #4, these are groups that consistently vote democrat. #**conclusion** so you basically have to ask yourself: which is worse, the (almost 100% mythical) threat of someone pretending to be someone else at the polls, or the (actual, verifiable) problem of valid voters not getting to cast a vote? in my opinion, if there were more instances of voter fraud than instances of legal voters without id, it would make sense. even if there were exactly the same amount of fraudulent votes as there were disenfranchised legal voters, i could see the argument. but here in the real world, we are talking literally millions of legal voters disenfranchised in an effort to combat the casting of literally tens of total votes across the country. and you will notice that the voter id laws are 100% pushed for by republican politicians, and the disenfranchised voters are 90% democratic voters. the sort of voter fraud that a voter id law would prevent can't meaningfully affect an election. disenfranchising people with voter id laws, on the other hand, can and does meaningfully swing elections for the republicans. --- an excellent rebuttal i found [here](",ctv3uo0,584.0782760197029,1,1438977607,42,5,-16367,0,58.488390804597714,696.0,1059.0,36.0,24,0.0,0.0,0.2777777777777778,0.5555555555555556,0.0,0.0,0.027777777777777776,0.0,0.0,0.027777777777777776,0.0,0.0,0.027777777777777776,0.0,0.9166666666666667,0.0891206016206016,0.22557471264367815,0.0,0,0.0,739,70.76,45.16,27.74,28.02,22.39,18.13,79.03,51.83,10.69,6.22,3.11,0.14,1.35,0.14,1.49,4.47,7.17,14.75,9.61,6.50,5.68,2.30,15.70,2.98,2.17,2.71,5.14,2.30,2.57,1.35,1.22,0.14,0.81,0.00,8.25,0.27,0.00,0.54,0.00,15.02,1.89,1.89,2.57,4.33,0.95,5.28,1.49,0.81,0.27,0.27,0.68,0.41,0.14,0.14,0.00,7.71,0.81,1.22,3.25,1.22,1.49,3.25,7.44,1.22,9.88,2.03,5.28,2.44,3.65,0.41,0.27,0.27,0.00,0.00,0.54,0.27,0.00,0.14,0.00,0.00,22.06,4.47,4.33,0.27,0.00,0.41,0.00,2.30,0.00,1.49,3.92,4.87

(because of all the shit they get) if i was allowed to go out without a burqa for one day. i would never miss a chance but i would probably think twice going out if you said that you are banning my protective shell. :/ >in hopes somebody can offer some personal experience well i am a bit hesitant here but there are pros and cons of wearing a burqa. >**pros:** no one forces me but i simply wearing it because of laziness. i can just wear the burqa and i never have to worry that i can't go out in pajama shorts and my hair looking like a birds nest. i freak out and might make silly faces infront of my crush but he will never notice (that's a con too sad ) if you take that away from me, i would probably be mad. >**cons:** i wear nice clothes and go out but i can't show it off. people think i am a grown up woman since they can't guess my age and would call me thier sister or aunt. it is not fun as a teenager. i do not think this was enough to change your view and i am probably late to the party but i thought to put my two cents in anyway :d",cskgniv,289.5033823042584,1,1435415880,329,38,62976,0,75.83186739602,461.0,603.0,23.0,1,0.0,0.0,0.5217391304347826,0.43478260869565216,0.0,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,NaN,0.23210412147505424,0.0,0,0.0,469,28.72,29.69,73.31,37.07,19.54,10.66,89.34,60.77,16.63,12.15,7.25,0.00,2.77,0.21,1.92,4.48,5.54,11.94,11.09,6.18,8.10,3.84,19.83,3.84,1.49,0.85,1.49,1.49,5.54,2.99,2.35,1.28,0.64,0.43,11.09,0.85,0.00,1.71,0.21,19.83,2.56,2.77,3.41,4.48,2.35,7.68,2.77,0.85,0.85,0.85,2.56,2.35,0.21,0.00,0.00,5.33,1.28,0.43,1.92,1.28,0.85,1.49,15.35,1.07,10.87,2.56,5.97,2.35,0.21,0.43,0.00,0.21,0.64,0.00,1.92,0.43,0.85,0.43,0.21,0.21,13.43,5.12,0.85,0.64,0.00,0.21,0.00,0.21,0.00,1.49,1.28,3.62

t3_320ncw,"as someone who has a master's in systematic theology, and who is pursing a career in a scientific field, i would suggest a different way of looking at the problem that proceeds along two tracks. the first track is to recognize that religion/spirituality in general is rarely fully about propositional claims and is more often about a combination of wittgenstein-esque ""language games"" and community belonging. being a member of a religious or spiritual group conveys a great many very real benefits those benefits have a value and that value attracts membership. so, arguing against her beliefs, when her beliefs are a proxy for that group membership is futile because it simply is not a material argument. the second track is to recognize that not all beliefs and actions serve the same purpose. things like hasidic dress, wearing a hijab and ardently espousing yec are all examples of costly signaling. costly signaling is a means of gaining trust in a community by enduring a personal cost to demonstrate trustworthiness. the reason hasidic diamond merchants and jewelers will exchange millions of dollars of merchandise on a handshake is because few people would dress that way if they didn't really want to be part of that community. likewise, being a vocal yec in american today comes at a high social price. therefore, espousing yec demonstrates that one is a trustworthy member of their particular religious community. this serves a very real economic function that reduces transaction cost across the community and allows for quick identification of who can and can not be considered trustworthy. if you like science, look at her behavior in terms of behavioral economics and you will realize that it is not that you should or should not argue with her, but rather, you have nothing to argue with her about -- at least with respect to the beliefs she is espousing in any context where you would have that sort of discussion. that does not mean you still might not have to tactfully dodge her questions or accusations or whatever, having a different viewpoint on your part will not change whatever interpersonal dynamic you share with her. but it should help you realize that any discussion about who is ""right"" entirely misses a much more important underlying consideration.",cq6typ1,226.09292888247404,1,1428608870,129,14,6190,0,39.32523809523812,378.0,626.0,14.0,19,0.14285714285714285,0.07142857142857142,0.35714285714285715,0.2857142857142857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8571428571428571,0.07375904010519395,0.2962962962962963,0.0,0,0.0,380,63.89,76.93,11.15,65.65,27.14,28.42,85.79,53.95,12.37,5.26,0.26,0.00,2.37,2.11,0.53,7.11,7.63,12.63,10.26,4.47,6.05,2.63,13.16,3.68,2.37,2.11,1.32,3.95,5.53,3.68,1.58,0.00,1.05,0.26,13.68,0.00,0.00,2.11,0.00,16.05,3.95,1.84,2.89,3.42,1.05,5.79,0.53,0.53,0.00,0.00,0.26,0.26,0.00,0.00,0.00,8.42,4.47,0.79,1.32,1.05,1.32,0.26,10.00,1.05,8.68,1.32,5.26,2.11,1.84,0.26,0.00,2.89,2.63,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,9.21,3.68,2.89,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.79,1.05,0.53,0.00,0.26

t3_2wwm6s,"it is a strangely fun thing to imagine these sorts of situations, and i think it is actually quite healthy to do in some ways. it helps us imagine the greatest risks to our society, how we can improve our chances, and what we should be sincerely worried about. while humanity is - in general - experiencing a level of health, wealth, and stability that we really have not experienced at any point in the past, this comes with its own set of problems. first off, we have never experienced the kind of population growth that we are experiencing today, and each person's lifestyle demands more resources from the earth than it ever has. so we have more people demanding more resources. that's the part where you start talking about food shortages as a result of population increase. to be sure, food is going to be a serious consideration in the future. however, with genetically modified organisms and advanced farming techniques our agricultural surpluses are the highest they have ever been, which is why we can sustain 7 billion people and counting. it is also important to remember that these advances often grow exponentially. as the population increases and more people are given access to education, our ability to create larger and larger agricultural surpluses tends to increase as well, as we have more minds working on these problems. it works dialectically. that said, the introduction of manmade climate change is going to be a new challenge. previously fertile land will be made largely infertile. *however*, the growing periods in northern regions are going to increase while this happens. whether or not that will make up for the loss of agriculture in other regions is not a certainty, but it is worth considering that climate change will affect different parts of the world differently. nordic tundra areas might gain more farmland and freshwater. to be sure, freshwater will be an issue, with the rapid pace of technological advancement, more efficient means of cloud-seeding and desalination are not beyond our scope. as for the mention of nuclear war, that threat is diminishing consistently. war is a very different thing nowadays, and there is much less of it than there has ever been in our history. as a military tactic, well-respected commanders like colin powell have said nuclear weapons are not particularly useful. furthermore, despite what we may see in the news, the world is a much more stable place today than it really ever has been. now, humanity never had the ability to wipe itself out until 70 years ago, so we really can't tell what will happen. however, war is not something that occurs internationally so much as *intra-nationally* nowadays, and paramilitary groups are not likely to use nuclear weapons in their own cities. a very important theory to consider here is called the ""21st century bottleneck."" this is essentially the idea that if society can hold it together through the 21st century, our population will stabilize at about 10 billion and stop increasing. that requires poor countries to continue getting richer, however, as populations tend to stabilize as people get richer. however, looking at economic growth worldwide you will see that the fastest growing economies are, in fact, in the global south. we are curing diseases, providing education, and improving agricultural techniques which allow a middle class to grow in these poorer countries. as bill gates continues to point out, things are actually going very well in poor countries, which is going to help global stability in the long run. right now, we are relying on the development of new technology to face the challenges posed by our current lifestyles. that may not be a bad idea, as the other option is to simply revert to a population and lifestyle that is not conducive to an advanced society. we can't simply stop using fossil fuels tomorrow or else our society will fall apart completely, so the hope is that we will be able to develop advanced forms of energy, as well as techniques to help us cope with the environmental changes that will occur as a result. if nothing else, humanity is adaptable. if we can just get by the 21st century, things really should stabilize. all in all, i think the better statement would be to say ""human society as we know it may not make it through the next hundred years,"" rather than the arbitrary 500 year mark. if we do make it past the 21st century bottleneck things are going to start looking up, mainly because of our immense rate of technological development based on increased population, access to education, and the exponential growth of technology. remember it was only about 200 years ago that infant mortality rate in the *richest* countries was worse than it is in the *poorest* countries today. if these trends continue, we will develop new advances in health, agriculture, energy, and resource development that we need to really thrive. after that, it comes down to exploring and colonizing space, which is what many of our brightest minds are encouraging us to start thinking about now. the best way to assure the continued survival of the human race is to start moving off the earth, so that we needn't rely on only one planet. sadly, i do not imagine that will be something that you or i will ever witness in our lifetimes, but there is a good chance our descendants will benefit from the resources found outside of earth. tl;dr i am actually pretty optimistic. technology and global trade are growing faster than we have ever seen, and that's only going

t3_3cwzdr,"i am going to take a slightly different tack in approaching this, because i agree with you that many of these issues being brought up are one hundred percent worth talking about and that oftentimes we are talking about them the wrong way. i am not going to argue that the ""pc police"" is inherently good and that the way we are approaching these issues (person said something questionable, ergo, he has a shitlord) is not somewhat problematic and toxic in the long run, because i believe most of the sites you have linked to are approaching issues in a totally different way than i think would be most helpful. rather, what i will argue is something more cynical: the publishers pushing the ""overboard social justice"" shenanigans you are talking about are doing exactly what they should, because what they are publishing is getting truckloads of clicks more than a nuanced take on the situation. financially, what they are doing makes total sense. look at it this way: say you have got two articles dealing with remarks made by a fortune 500 ceo that could easily be construed as sexist. the article from publication a is a 3,000-word inquiry into the deeper sentiments held behind those remarks, which treats the ceo as a human being with human prejudices (prejudices similar to those that all people hold) and examines why, exactly, those sexist remarks are so hurtful in a deeply nuanced tone which invites deeper critical consideration and does not provide an easy emotional response. the article from publication b is an 800-word evisceration of the ceo as a horrible, unredeemable person representing everything wrong with corporate culture and a beacon of light for slug-headed sexists everywhere. it jumps straight to anger, because it knows it can get its readers angry enough to share the article. which do you think will get more clicks, shares, and comments? emotion is a powerful force, and many publications are very skilled at manipulating that. i am white, male, and straight, so i do not have the kind of anger at our society that many minority groups hold. however, many us women are exhausted by the harassment and bigotry they face as a part of the experience of being a woman in the us. same with people of color, same with lgbtqa+ people, same with non-christian people (especially muslims). they are the target audience for many of these pieces - the articles tap into the anger they feel at having to survive as a ""lesser person"" simply because of some part of their identity they can't control. as such, if an article can trigger that kind of strong emotion, the author of the article knows that with a snappy headline and angry enough writing, they can make an article ""worth sharing."" at some level, i think that the ""pc-ness,"" as you put it, is justified. people want ways to vent their frustration at being oppressed in america while people bluster on about how we are in a post-racial society and such, and these quick, snarky, angry articles are a perfect way to encapsulate that rage (even if that rage might not be the most constructive). there are so many people who are pissed, always at the boiling point because society has not let them be anywhere else. however, since they are always at the boiling point, countless publications have figured out the buttons they need to push in order to boil them over the sides of the pot. and, until something changes, that's the best business strategy for most of these publications - whatever gets clicks, you know? tl;dr - what you are describing is not super helpful, but, hey, clicks and profit!",cszr0ac,558.6748412297043,1,1436632223,138,18,2805,0,49.29383821932686,614.0,928.0,21.0,9,0.0,0.0,0.23809523809523808,0.23809523809523808,0.0,0.047619047619047616,0.0,0.047619047619047616,0.0,0.0,0.047619047619047616,0.0,0.047619047619047616,0.047619047619047616,0.7142857142857144,0.07036016448740234,0.26221498371335505,0.0,0,0.0,621,69.90,76.56,18.50,6.24,29.57,22.38,87.12,52.66,13.37,6.28,1.45,0.97,1.29,0.16,2.42,7.09,8.53,12.72,9.82,3.70,6.28,1.29,15.46,6.60,4.03,1.93,1.13,3.70,6.60,2.25,4.03,0.16,2.90,0.16,11.11,0.00,0.00,0.32,0.32,13.37,2.42,3.06,1.45,2.58,1.77,3.06,2.74,0.64,1.45,0.32,1.45,0.48,0.48,0.00,0.00,7.73,2.09,0.97,2.42,2.25,0.48,0.81,11.76,1.29,10.31,2.09,6.92,0.97,2.25,0.00,0.00,0.97,0.32,0.00,0.81,0.32,0.16,0.16,0.00,0.00,15.14,2.90,6.44,0.32,0.16,0.32,0.16,1.45,1.61,0.32,1.29,0.16

t3_3jc643,"> for homicides, ""the offending rate for blacks was almost 8 times higher than whites""[3] . ""adjusted for the homicide rate, whites are 1.7 times more likely than blacks die at the hands of police""[4] this is commonly referenced, but a non sequitur. typically, people that cite this statistic will cite the **rate** and not the total number. in this case, however, the rate is not as important as the total number. to illustrate this, please consider this example: if black people commit a crime at a rate of 0.0001%, and white people commit a crime at 0.00001%, then i could write a statistically true headline that reads; **blacks commit crime 'x' at 10 *times* the rate of whites**. while being factually accurate, it is intentionally misleading in its nature. this is the problem with people that constantly cite the murder rate. in 2013 there were about 14,000 murders *total*. in a country of 300,000,000. if half of those were blacks, then that puts us at 7000. if we are generous, and assume that all of these murders are committed by unique individuals (as in no single person shooting multiple people), then we still have 7000 murderers total. how many black people in the united states again? 41,000,000. therefore, the chances of a black person **not** being a murderer are greater than 99.99%. sure, for whites and asians it might be 99.999% or 99.9999%, but mentioning *only* the rate gives you the false impression that this is a very large number of people we are dealing with. it isn't. this is also the problem with people citing: blacks kill whites like 10000000 times more than whites kill blacks. > statistically true, but the amount of whites murdered by blacks in an entire year is only about 350 people *total*. to put that in context, 5000 people die every year from food poisoning. this also does not factor in how differences in pop. size can skew the rates. if you are white, the chances of a big scary black guy coming to kill you is essentially nil. blacks kill police officers way more than whites do >true again, but the amount of police officers that are murdered is shockingly low. about 51 were murdered last year if i recall correctly. that's in total. [here is an article using the same kind of bad math that i am talking about here](the issue we are running into is small sample sizes skewing the data. when a crime is committed relatively rarely, it is frighteningly easy for the statistics to be skewed more heavily. it can create a catchy headline, but it is junk mathematically. the most dangerous consequence is that it ***sounds*** very convincing to laymen who do not understand the actual math. you may have noticed that i have not really grappled with your cmv topic yet. the reason i felt it was important to explain what i explained above, is that it appears you have the very common viewpoint of: well the reason blacks are getting shot so much is because they are like 5 million percent more dangerous.. it is of crucial importance to communicate that this belief is misguided. the amount of black people that are dangerous enough to commit murder is infinitely small, and very few police are killed in the line of duty overall. now, to get to your cmv. typically when people talk about police shootings they are talking about *unjustified* police shootings. this means that lumping in all police shootings (which is what you have done) is mathematically unsound. people typically look at unarmed people who get shot. if someone is unarmed, there is *very* little reason to shoot them, barring extreme circumstance. if you look at those numbers, it seems clear to people that unarmed black people are getting shot a lot more. why is this? many people think it is because black people are viewed as being extremely dangerous, and there are many police that are...well...[like this](",cuo0uze,743.7999129183116,1,1441197138,67,6,6377,0,67.6771320093458,642.0,953.0,48.0,4,0.08333333333333333,0.020833333333333332,0.16666666666666666,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.020833333333333332,0.0,0.0,0.020833333333333332,0.0,0.0,0.08333333333333333,0.0,0.6458333333333334,0.08524147247551503,0.21806853582554517,0.0,0,0.0,670,59.84,63.43,15.56,6.12,16.34,16.27,81.04,51.04,11.34,3.43,0.90,0.75,1.34,0.00,0.45,7.91,6.72,11.79,10.60,6.87,5.52,1.19,14.63,6.12,3.58,1.49,4.48,4.48,6.27,2.24,4.03,0.30,2.39,0.15,7.76,0.00,0.15,0.00,0.15,14.78,2.54,2.24,1.49,3.43,3.73,4.33,2.54,1.94,0.15,0.45,0.60,0.15,0.30,0.00,0.15,5.82,0.90,0.30,2.84,0.60,1.19,1.49,11.94,1.04,8.66,0.60,4.63,3.28,2.09,0.15,0.00,0.00,0.15,2.39,0.30,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.30,0.00,21.64,6.72,5.07,0.45,0.15,0.30,0.00,0.00,0.60,0.60,0.90,6.87
t3_3f0uzz,"i feel like your argument boils down to ""technology changes lifestyles and that's bad."" i really disagree with you on that. >a lot of technology today encourages laziness. the automobile encourages me not to walk places, but it also allows me to travel further and faster. what one calls laziness, another could call saving time. >example: ""alexa, add waffles to my shopping list."" now we do not even need to jot things down or even type them into our smart phones at the very least. which i think is great! i can open my refrigerator and note each thing without forgetting anything because i had to close it. i have saved time not writing things down by hand, and energy from opening/closing the refrigerator. i could even add things to the list while i drive to the store, without taking my hands off the wheel or eyes off the road. >example: 'alexa can provide news!' instead of reading the newspaper or watching the news we can listen to a mono-tone robot recite world events. how is this different than turning on the radio? >example: ""alexa, what is the chance of rain?"" the woman is literally standing next to the door when she asks this question. however, she would rather receive the weather from her nifty new gadget than to actually look outside or watch a weather report. i do not know about you, but where i live during the rainy season the weather shifts drastically over the day. i can't tell what the weather will be in four hours from looking outside, so i check online. again, this is just saving time, i do not see how it is lazy to use voice control rather than go over to the computer or take out a smartphone to check the weather... it is convenient! >reason 2: reliance on technology technology is created to alter our lifestyles. to many that seems scary, and i get it, come the zombie apocalypse our people are doomed without their iphones. you could argue that our society has become overly dependent on things like automobiles, electricity, the internet, etc... but you could also argue that these technologies have changed our lifestyles for the better. electricity allowed us to work and live into the night, automobiles connected our countries and peoples aiding in travel and cultural exchange, and the internet allowed for us to become a global society as well as more educated when all the information in the world was accessible. >we find it difficult to go out and make plans. how so? i find it easier now that i have group texts and can make exact plans. when i was a kid, you called someone's home, left a message, and hoped they called back. then after you make plans you would have to wait for your friend to show up. now with texting, i know exactly where i need to be and when. it is simplified planning a lot more. > we find it difficult to socialize. in the era of ""social media"" i very much disagree. we socialize with more people from further away more often and in depth than ever before. consider this very thread as evidence of that... socializing is different than it used to be, but it is still socializing. >in a world full of constant updates and fast information, why should we access things in any other way? we want things instantaneously and at our discretion. exactly, it is wonderful. we live in an era of calling people out on their bullshit, fact checking, providing new and insightful anecdotes all the time. we consume information more and more every day, and i think it leads to a more enlightened society. >reason 3: invasion of privacy just going to throw this out there, ""always listening"" != always recording. the two are not synonymous. >major corporations will do anything to learn more about consumers and what they want. when worded like that, it sounds ominous, until you end with a statement like ""to better target and develop products for that consumer."" businesses are not evil, they just make money. some do it by selling products or services, and consumer data is a way to create better products and target them better to make more money. that's not a bad thing, it is a modern way of doing business. in addition, businesses do not have to do anything to get consumer data when consumers provide plenty of it for free online through social media. >example: 'echo can hear you from anywhere in the room, so it is always ready to help!' ""i can have the water running, i can be cooking, the tv can be on in the back room, and she still can hear me."" it seems spooky, but it is a pretty cool system. you could throw in safety or security programs, like ""echo call 911!"" or have it do it automatically if it hears someone break in. cool all in one system. and like i said before, ""always listening"" does not mean ""always recording."" audio data is pretty bulky, and they are not recording everything all the time for all time. the way it works is by transmitting the bare minimum amount of data to a cloud server to interpret the signal, then send back the instructions, and deleting the data when finished. they are not recording you for posterity. also, it has an off switch. and lastly, a point you may not realize is that voice recognition is one of the hot beds of audio dsp (digital signal processing) research. it is products like echo, siri, cortana, etc that are providing the money and incentive for this research. that seems like it is not that big of a deal, but it could have massive implications for our technological society, as well as cultural areas like film, television, and music. computers are a major part of our society. a computer has to take user input to generate an output that is meaningful. the standard way of a user entering information is with a keyboard and mouse. now, the issue is that not everyone can use a keyboard and mouse. in a society where so much of our activity is reliant on computers, this puts disabled people or those who simply can't use a keyboard/mouse at a major disadvantage. voice recognition is the answer here... the issue is that voice recognition technology is incredibly complex and difficult to get working because there are so many factors. it is because of these products from amazon, apple and microsoft that voice recognition is really taking off, which will help many people down the line. as well, eliminating the keyboard and mouse allows us to use computers in more integrated ways than we have ever before... who knows how that will affect society? i am hopeful, and i think it is going to be cool. i am biased though, as i am involved in the world of audio dsp. in addition, the dsp behind voice recognition is going to make headway into the production of audio and video art forms. we have already seen technology drive music from everything from pop to rock to dance music today. television and film are largely driven by technology as well, for example the first program to synthesize the human voice was written at bell labs in 1959, and was used in the kubrick film *2001*. my point is that voice recognition is and will become more important in the creation of digital media. products like echo are providing the money to fund that research and development.",ctk8tb6,2801.3681806173036,1,1438181971,217,39,3610,0,63.49656168254636,1262.0,1908.0,83.0,5,0.0963855421686747,0.0,0.14457831325301204,0.10843373493975904,0.0,0.0,0.012048192771084338,0.0,0.0,0.012048192771084338,0.0,0.012048192771084338,0.04819277108433735,0.0,0.4337349397590361,NaN,0.2218700475435816,0.0,0,0.0,1270,64.35,63.56,58.46,49.20,15.49,19.06,86.77,54.65,13.62,6.77,2.76,1.89,1.10,0.31,0.71,6.85,6.69,14.41,8.82,5.12,7.32,1.57,15.28,5.12,3.94,1.81,0.87,2.76,3.62,2.44,1.18,0.08,0.24,0.08,9.06,0.00,0.08,0.39,0.00,14.57,3.23,3.39,1.42,2.44,1.57,4.17,3.23,0.71,1.97,0.55,0.79,0.24,0.31,0.00,0.16,7.32,2.76,1.50,1.73,1.26,0.71,1.42,12.99,1.26,13.86,2.05,7.17,5.04,3.31,1.81,0.39,1.57,0.08,0.08,0.63,0.08,0.00,0.24,0.31,0.00,16.61,6.46,5.04,0.47,0.00,0.39,0.47,0.08,1.57,0.71,0.16,1.26

'it feels lazier' is not a valid conclusion supported by data. reason 2: reliance on technology you are already completely, utterly, and irreversibly reliant on technology. others have made this point but i want to stress the absolute and total reality of it to you. every single item around you is human technology. building a fire is technology. you will die very quickly if you stopped using technology. you failed to demonstrate why reliance on technology is bad in general, and why reliance on echo is bad specifically. you say >'clearly there are many issues with one piece of technology keeping a household together' but you do not elaborate on what these issues are, or provide evidence that these issues actually exist. you could argue that a family car, a refrigerator, or even the house itself keeps a household together. these are all technology. by your argument, these would all be problematic for some mysterious and unstated reason. your other example: >'shop by shouting a phrase at a robot, no need to go out' this is equally presumptuous and ill-defined. firstly, you have not actually stated why 'not going out' is a bad thing. maybe it lets me have more time to relax at home instead of standing in line at the market, which is definitely a positive outcome for me. secondly, you assume that not shopping equals not going out, which is plainly not true. maybe with the time that i save by not going to the store, i go out and do something else instead, like see a movie, hang out with friends, or go hiking. here, your argument is based on unfounded assumptions and cannot support your claim. when you say 'reliance on technology' what you seem to really mean is that 'we are too reliant on some particular technologies like smartphones and the internet, but it is ok to be reliant on other technologies like electricity and modern food production.' you have picked some arbitrary limit on technological advancement, for example 2006 (just before smartphones) or 1985 (just before popular consumer internet) and have decided that that's the right amount of technology to be reliant on. however, you still have not provided any convincing arguments as to why that particular level of technology is the right one. > in a world full of constant updates and fast information, why should we access things in any other way? indeed, why? you are claiming that making things slower and more difficult would be better. it is your job to answer this question. reason 3: invasion of privacy yes, this may be a legitimate concern generally. however, it is true of many technologies aside from echo. you have not argued sufficiently that echo is worse in this regard, or provided any actual evidence that privacy has been invaded. the potential for harm to occur is not the same as harm actually occurring. if we banned technology based on the potential for harm, we would have to ban basically everything: kitchen knives, leather belts, baseball bats, you get the idea. in summation, i have shown that your position on this issue is flawed in specific and demonstrable ways. you cannot make the claim you are making without updating or revising your position, and therefore must change your view.",ctkbyhm,1615.2762583984236,1,1438186775,217,39,8414,0,52.54637088896126,664.0,1068.0,37.0,1,0.0,0.02702702702702703,0.24324324324324326,0.1891891891891892,0.0,0.0,0.05405405405405406,0.02702702702702703,0.02702702702702703,0.02702702702702703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5945945945945945,0.07084751668085003,0.2575301204819277,0.0,0,0.0,672,53.30,70.40,47.90,10.67,18.16,22.77,84.23,54.61,14.14,7.14,0.89,0.74,5.51,0.00,0.00,6.99,5.51,12.95,9.67,6.25,5.21,2.53,15.62,4.61,3.42,1.93,1.49,3.27,4.76,1.79,2.98,0.15,0.89,0.15,9.08,0.15,0.15,0.00,0.00,20.09,2.98,4.61,1.79,4.46,2.53,6.55,1.49,0.30,0.74,0.45,0.45,0.00,0.15,0.00,0.30,5.06,1.34,1.34,0.45,1.04,1.49,1.64,12.05,1.04,12.05,2.68,6.70,3.27,1.49,1.19,0.89,0.89,0.00,0.15,0.60,0.00,0.15,0.45,0.00,0.00,15.18,4.91,5.65,0.74,0.00,0.60,0.00,0.30,0.00,1.93,0.60,0.45

t3_344gt3,"the saying goes average minds talk events and great minds talk about ideas. ideas are a hard point to sell, often because of the emotion attached to it. when you have an event it is easy to iterate about it in an essay. essays convey a simple no brainer event quite easily but when you have something more complex than that, how do you convey it? you use poetry. all religious scripts use poetry. why? because not only does it deliver a message it captivates the reader and touches their heart to win them over. poetry has that power. now you might be against religion ( i do not know) but poetry has been used to convey other ideas too like history and philosophy. before the written word was a thing, people would recite poems and songs from bards because they didn't know how to read and preserve their knowledge in written form. so knowledge would be transferred in the form of poetry because how easy it was to remember it compared to linear form of writing. also, entertainment is not useless. saying entertainment is useless is reducing us to mindless animals whose sole purpose is to feed and procreate. we have evolved to become more than that and our mind needs fuel for the soul. i sound a little new age here but what i mean to say is that we have gone past the point where we are just content with surviving. we need a good meaningful life and that is achieved through various forms of entertainment like theater,music and poetry.",cqr98wc,799.7574970433809,1,1430213284,24,10,9748,0,70.10427256398744,262.0,375.0,17.0,2,0.11764705882352941,0.0,0.17647058823529413,0.11764705882352941,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058823529411764705,0.0,0.0,0.47058823529411764,0.07992788461538462,0.2786259541984733,0.0,0,0.0,263,41.32,71.58,27.94,75.21,15.47,18.25,87.83,55.51,13.69,6.84,1.14,2.28,1.90,0.00,1.52,6.84,5.70,12.17,10.65,6.46,8.75,1.90,17.87,6.08,3.42,3.42,0.00,1.90,4.56,3.42,0.76,0.00,0.00,0.76,8.75,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,16.73,4.56,4.56,1.52,1.52,0.38,4.18,3.04,0.00,2.28,0.76,1.52,0.76,0.38,0.00,0.38,6.84,2.66,1.52,2.28,1.52,0.00,3.80,12.93,0.38,9.13,1.52,3.42,4.18,2.28,4.56,0.00,0.38,1.14,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,9.51,5.70,1.90,0.00,0.00,0.76,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.38,0.76,0.00
t3_2zow2m,"i do not know whether this will change your view, but when i was 19 years old, i was in a very similar mindset as you. much like you, everyone i liked seemed to either be in a relationship or was not attracted to me, or both. much like you, i was frustrated and even a little angry that something that seemed so fundamental to the human experience seemed inaccessible to me, and, much like you, i viewed all this as proof of my own lack of worth in this world that, again much like you, i felt could only be addressed by being in a relationship. with these bona fides established, let me tell you the story of my first relationship: i was in college, freshman year, and we met about a month into the semester when i made a reference to a j-pop band and she was the only one at the table who got it. we had a conversation that lasted many hours and, throughout the next month, would hang out a lot and begin cuddling and the like. this eventually turned into a relationship that lasted for a little less than a year. we were also, incidentally, both virgins. about a month and a half into our relationship, we decided we loved each other and had sex for the first time. i am not going to lie, it was pretty nice. however, ""pretty nice"" was not what i was expecting. i was expecting something transcendent, something that would fundamentally change who i was into something better. this didn't happen. we woke up as the same people we were before, except more naked. we got dressed and went about our day. we were together for a little shy of one year and we had sex many times during this period. **you're expecting a story with a moral along the lines of ""so if you only wait, you will get what you want!"" this is not one of those stories. the moral has not yet appeared. keep reading.** because i had never before been in a relationship, and because i had been so fixated on getting into one before, i did not really have a reliable way to know what was and was not normal in relationships, and further (because i only focused on *getting* a relationship, not *being in* a relationship) was largely disconnected from what i actually wanted in a relationship. it took me a long, long time to understand that i was deeply unhappy. i didn't like how she expected me to be with her whenever i was not in class or at some club activity. i didn't like how, when i was with her, she wanted to do the same things all the time. i didn't like how she only wanted us to hang out with her friends, but would balk if i suggested we do something with my own, and i didn't like how i began losing some of my friends because i was barely spending any time with them. i didn't like how she judged people who drank or smoked, and how she would give me the stink eye if i even mentioned i would gone to a party where i drank. i didn't like the jealousy she had of my friendship with another girl, and didn't like how threatened someone who was just a friend made her feel. i didn't like her steadfast refusal to communicate when there was clearly something bothering her. i didn't like that she almost broke up with me because i wanted to play virtua fighter with my suite-mate instead of hang out with her for *one night.* what a lot of these things came down to was i didn't like feeling she owned me. yes, we were having sex, but i disliked how she never initiated, how she never wanted to do anything except missionary in her bed in a dark room, and how much sex itself seemed to be something she tolerated but never actually wanted. not to say i was the innocent party here--i will not go into detail, but i too did things she disliked. what the fuck, right? i got everything i wanted: i had a girlfriend (who was a virgin, though for me this was not that important) who wanted to spend lots and lots of time with me, who was extremely cute and talented and geeky (she had more anime and manga than most retailers), who loved me (we said it to each other the night we had sex) and only me. i *made* it, i *won.* i finally got what i wanted after all this time. but i was so, so sad. eventually we broke up by mutual decision. having a relationship, with someone who was a virgin no less, was not the answer to all my problems. at best, you could say i swapped out one set of problems for another. before getting into a relationship, i thought of it as an endpoint, the culmination of years and years of wanting and hoping and masturbating. it was the ending of the movie for me, the happy ending that goes to credits scored by some pop punk single by a now-forgotten band. i was wrong. it was not the end. it was not even the beginning of the end. it was merely the end of the beginning. congrats, you got your girlfriend! now what? you believe getting a girlfriend who is a virgin is the answer to all your problems. from experience, speaking as someone who was thinking pretty much exactly the things you are saying now (besides the insistence on virginity--i was never that concerned about that), i can tell you it isn't. being in a relationship does not make you a complete person. being in a relationship does not insulate you from the judgment of others, they just find something else to judge you on. being in a relationship will not save you from feeling bad and, in fact, may even make you feel *worse* than if you had stayed single. it will not fix long term feelings of inadequacy or emptiness--though, yes, in the short term it can, this is simply not sustainable; those feelings will just creep back with slightly different language much like a cold virus mutated just enough to fool your antibodies. this is because, as i learned, this is not what relationships are for, it is not what they do, and it is not how they work. i was looking at a bunch of nails that needed hammering, but thought what i really needed was a drill. now, a drill can be quite nice, and useful for what drills can actually be used for, but a drill is a poor tool for hammering nails. you, specifically you, only think you need a drill. what you need is a hammer. the hammer, in this case, being the development of internal emotional resources, which can be facilitated by a combination of therapy and just plain life experience. if your emotional well-being is constantly in the hands of others, those others have great power over you simply because they can take it away from you at any time. on a macro scale, it is like a country that depends entirely on another for the sum whole of its economic stability; the country that provides it has vast power over the country that receives it. this is why countries do their best not to let that happen. how to develop these resources? i am in my 30s now and, truthfully, i am still working on that. i am still insecure and anxious and turn everything into some symbol for where my life is going and what it means about me, and i still struggle with self-hatred and depression and the internalized manifestations of bullying i received when i was much younger. i do not know what to do. but what i *do* know is that it takes more than a relationship to do it. it takes a lot of work, a lot of introspection and a good network of empathetic friends who will listen to you when times are tough and laugh with you when times are good. a relationship would be the cherry on top, sure, but a sundae is more than just the cherry, much more, even if it is improved by its addition. none of this is to say you should not pursue relationships. as per the tool metaphor i used earlier, while a drill cannot hammer a nail, a hammer cannot drill a hole. having a drill can be great, and do lots of things for you. but do not expect it to hammer nails. so, getting literal, having a relationship can be great (though, as my story tells, this is not a guarantee), but you cannot expect it to fix all the other problems in your life. if you do, you will be disappointed.",cpl22pp,851.9850912131539,1,1426868377,153,26,11989,0,68.64554548704201,1492.0,2081.0,75.0,3,0.04,0.0,0.24,0.08,0.013333333333333334,0.0,0.05333333333333334,0.013333333333333334,0.0,0.013333333333333334,0.013333333333333334,0.0,0.04,0.02666666666666667,0.5333333333333332,NaN,0.16890080428954424,0.0,0,0.0,1501,28.35,48.13,55.20,37.56,20.85,15.12,93.74,64.42,20.25,11.73,6.00,1.20,2.66,1.47,0.40,8.53,7.20,12.92,11.19,6.33,7.46,3.40,18.32,4.40,3.06,3.53,0.80,3.46,5.60,3.06,2.40,0.40,0.53,0.60,11.53,0.00,0.53,1.53,0.00,16.92,1.93,2.07,3.00,3.46,1.80,6.33,1.73,0.33,0.53,0.60,1.60,0.20,0.27,0.87,0.20,7.93,3.80,1.00,1.33,1.67,0.73,7.79,8.26,1.33,11.99,1.13,5.53,5.60,1.00,0.47,0.13,0.47,0.20,0.00,0.33,0.13,0.00,0.13,0.07,0.00,15.92,4.66,6.13,0.13,0.13,0.20,0.13,0.73,0.27,1.53,0.80,1.20

t3_3hf5e7,"**tl;dr:** ""they"" does not work as a singular because when you use it in context with ""they"" as a plural, it confuses who you are referring to, because you keep saying the same pronoun while the antecedent changes. a lot of people are making the point of clarity and confusion. one user said ""he stabbed me"" is clear because you know how many people did it, whereas ""they stabbed me"" is unclear if it is a group or a single person without a specified gender. this example, while fair, does negate the existence of antecedents and context that would clear up the confusion. so let us try an example with context: >one day, jordan?a genderqueer person?discovered the westboro baptist church was going to rally outside their school. their principal recently announced that they were going to implement gender-neutral bathrooms to support the queer students in the school. this made jordan happy, but clearly the wbc was displeased, so they approached them. *they said, ""we do not want your kind here.""* for the most part in this example, it is clear who ""they"" is referring to. but in the last sentence, if we used a pronoun?which makes perfect sense to use, given how we have written earlier?there becomes a discrepancy. ""they"" could refer to jordan, telling the wbc that bigots were unwelcome, or it could refer to the wbc, saying that *queer people* were unwelcome. (now, i chose an example for when we go beyond the gender-binary, but this case works for when you are simply unable to identify a person's gender, if you are not referring to a specific person but a general one, etc. it does not just apply to trans* people.) in the sentences ""a person creeped up behind me. they were breathing very heavily. suddenly, a knife entered my back."" and ""a group of people creeped up behind me. they were breathing very heavily. suddenly, a knife entered my back."" it is clear how many people are responsible for the stabbing, despite using the same pronoun. however, notice in the second sentence, the same verb is used: ""were"". english, albeit to a lessee degree than romance languages like spanish, conjugate their verbs to match the number and person. ""i am,"" ""you are,"" and ""s/he is"" are all singular forms of ""to be."" plurals are ""we are,"" ""you are,"" and ""they are."" if we have ""they"" as a singular, then we are not changing how we conjugate verbs applied to it. so we can't use that as a clue as to who it is referring to. now, let us go back to my example. but, instead of ""they,"" let us use ""thon,"" a gender-neutral pronoun that is a contraction of ""that one."" >one day, jordan?a genderqueer person?discovered the westboro baptist church was going to rally outside thon's school. thon's principal recently announced that they were going to implement gender-neutral bathrooms to support the queer students in the school. this made jordan happy, but clearly the wbc was displeased, so thon approached them. *they said, ""we do not want your kind here.""* here, we understand exactly who was insulting whom at the end: the wbc explained how they do not approve of queer students. before, it was uncertain; now, we are sure. by using an alternative gender-neutral pronoun, we are able to have interactions between singular and plural entities without mixing the two up. it provides a clear link between pronoun and antecedent.",cu729a5,764.6346965644784,1,1439912358,347,30,24726,0,67.58344463801784,574.0,835.0,36.0,2,0.0,0.0,0.2222222222222222,0.2222222222222222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027777777777777776,0.0,0.0,0.027777777777777776,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.6111111111111112,0.027607709750566898,0.1916376306620209,0.0,0,0.0,587,52.60,83.85,23.65,47.85,17.26,21.81,82.79,56.90,15.16,9.88,1.53,2.73,1.70,0.34,3.58,5.28,9.03,11.41,9.71,5.62,7.67,1.87,16.35,4.43,2.56,2.39,1.36,1.53,2.56,1.87,0.68,0.17,0.17,0.00,13.63,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.34,15.67,2.90,3.75,1.53,2.39,2.04,4.77,1.87,0.85,0.85,0.00,1.19,0.34,0.17,0.68,0.00,7.16,3.75,0.85,2.04,0.51,0.00,4.94,10.39,0.85,9.37,2.04,4.09,3.75,1.87,0.34,0.34,0.00,0.68,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,26.24,6.13,7.33,0.68,0.34,0.00,0.00,0.85,7.50,0.68,0.34,2.39

t3_2wt9ya,"all of the reasons you have offered to doubt moral realism (the thesis that there are mind-independent moral facts) are pretty weak. one by one: >human perception of morality varies wildly based on time, place, situation, and who you ask. but this is true of non-moral matters as well. humans used to think that the sun revolved around the earth, and now we think that the earth revolves around the sun. but this does not mean that there is no fact of the matter about astronomy. so the fact that moral beliefs change can't be evidence to think that there is no fact of the matter of morality. >as another example, i once had a very heated argument with a religious friend who claimed that cannibalism was objectively wrong. it is disrespectful to the dead. however, some cultures consider eating your dead a way of showing respect. well, there a couple of different responses the committed moral realist might offer here. first, we might say that one of these groups is simply wrong: maybe religions that think cannibalism is wrong are mistaken, or maybe cultures that practice cannibalism are mistaken. this is not a very appealing response, though. a more promising response is to say that respecting the dead is a moral imperative. which actions count as respectful toward the dead might vary by culture, but this does not mean that what is right and wrong actually varies by culture. >humans do not agree on moral issues...if morality were objective, we would all agree on these issues. but again, humans disagree about all sorts of issues. for instance, there is disagreement about which interpretation of quantum physics is correct, but that does not seem to suggest that there is no fact of the matter about which interpretation is correct. in fact, disagreement is a pretty good indicator that there is a fact of the matter--otherwise, what could the disagreement even be about? moreover, there are at least some moral issues that face widespread agreement. pretty much everyone agrees, i take it, that it is wrong to set babies on fire for fun. there are controversial moral questions, but i do not think most moral questions are controversial. >legality is a human construct, and is an attempt to enforce objective morality onto a relatively moral world. this is why the law is not always right. for example, criminals can sometimes get away with their actions by finding a loophole, and innocent people can be punished for breaking the law, even when it seems obvious that their actions were not immoral and did not present any significant danger to anyone. therefore, objective morality cannot work in the real world. this reasoning seems very confused to me. you conclude that ""objective morality cannot work in the real world,"" but objective morality is not supposed to ""work."" the thesis that there exist mind-independent moral facts is not a plan of action that can succeed or fail to succeed. if i say that objective morality exists, i have not said anything about whether or not people act in the morally correct way. and moreover, if you believe that ""the law is not always right,"" it looks like you *have* to believe that there are objective moral facts, because there has to be a standard that the law fails to meet when it goes wrong. >human morality often reflects evolution. (and evolution can be used to explain certain ""objective"" morals) we intuitively value altruism because it is good for the population. we despise child abuse because we have an instinctive urge to protect our young. sure, but there are lots of counterexamples too. for instance, most people agree that racism is morally wrong, but there are evolutionary benefits to racism. rape is also evolutionarily beneficial under some circumstances, but we are still pretty convinced that rape is wrong. so it is not like our moral beliefs are slaves to our evolutionary origins. that may be the origin of many of our moral beliefs, but we are pretty good at reasoning, and we have abandoned some of the ones we decided were wrong.",cotxkuk,2774.6077224865267,1,1424651817,192,20,3086,0,55.17528780743069,686.0,1085.0,39.0,22,0.10256410256410256,0.05128205128205128,0.3333333333333333,0.8461538461538461,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05128205128205128,0.0,0.07692307692307693,0.05128205128205128,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.5128205128205128,0.06750208855472013,0.19970845481049562,0.0,0,0.0,691,46.14,53.47,31.39,25.77,18.18,21.85,89.29,53.69,12.01,4.05,0.87,2.03,0.87,0.00,0.29,7.96,6.22,11.14,11.14,7.09,5.93,3.04,15.63,3.47,1.45,1.59,0.72,2.60,8.39,4.20,4.20,0.29,0.87,0.43,7.81,0.14,0.14,0.00,0.00,20.98,4.49,2.75,1.01,5.93,3.33,5.93,1.16,0.29,0.58,0.14,0.72,0.14,0.14,0.29,0.14,8.39,2.46,1.45,2.17,1.16,2.03,1.74,14.04,0.87,7.81,1.16,3.91,2.60,2.46,0.14,0.00,0.00,4.49,0.58,0.72,0.00,0.00,0.43,0.29,0.00,15.20,5.79,5.35,0.29,0.00,0.14,0.00,0.72,1.16,0.14,0.58,1.01
t3_2wt9ya,"i will keep my quotes from you short (but accurate), so that it is not a huge wall of text. >human perception of morality varies wildly based on [multiple factors] that's not morality, that's the social norm and law of the land. the whims of civilizations determine what the norm is and what is regarded as right and wrong but they do not determine objective morality. slavery of a human being was, is, and always will be wrong. why didn't they realize this back when it was legal? some did, but think of it like science: morality needs to be discovered. remember we came from a bunch of apes on the fields of africa, we knew nothing of how fire worked until we researched it and understood it and the same is true for what is right and wrong. killing another person without cause (ex. self-defense) is, was, and always will be wrong. we do things that are immoral, but that does not change the truth of universal morality. > cannibalism cannibalism is not universally wrong. in some cases it is needed to survive. additionally if the person being eaten and the person doing the eaten both consent, then where is the immorality? if joe danger loses his leg due to natural causes, why would it be immoral to eat it? ""icky""? absolutely. out of place in western society? to be sure. culturally (not universally) immoral? yes. >euthanasia, abortion, and war those are moral debates that may one day have an objective truth. similarly they might be forever in a gray area. they are cultural debates though and not universal morality. >legality is... not the topic at hand. laws and morality are very different beasts. sometimes they coincide, but remember that for many, many years slavery was legal. that didn't make slavery morally correct, that made it legal. >human morality often reflects evolution [and can therefore be culturally or geographically linked] again this is a difference between culture and morality. it also brings forth the idea of morality as something that is discovered (evolved, if you prefer). i will re-iterate: we all came from apes, we knew nothing of science or morality. over time we researched and discovered a lot about both and through that our views changed. some lines of research are complete (ex. slavery is wrong), some lines of research continue (ex. euthanasia), and some may we may never be able to fully resolve (ex. abortion?). >to use an example from popular culture, [orson card's] formics. that's an apples and oranges comparison. formics are not human. they had the ansibles which are a technology humans would never conceive because we are individually-minded. similarly to how humans wouldn't have researched the ansibles, formics had no reason to research morality (without individualism there would be no need to evaluate the value of an individual). if you recall though, once humans educated formics in morality, the formics (like a good scientist would) evaluated the claims and adjusted their world view accordingly. overall you conflate social norms, laws, and moral debate with morality. if you think of morality in the same vein as science, you will see that as humanity discovers ""moral truths"" (moral values which the overwhelming majority of the world accepts) they spread through the world without abatement, regardless of moral values that were once accepts as the norm. the prime example is slavery: since we did the research and recognized that all humans are equal, the idea that slavery is universally morally wrong has spread ceaselessly. just like new scientific discoveries see resistance, there is always a chance universal moral values see resistance, but it does not change their objective and universal nature.",cotyuzj,2185.8947489210796,1,1424654186,192,20,5455,0,53.93090312727779,613.0,1012.0,47.0,1,0.0851063829787234,0.0425531914893617,0.1702127659574468,0.1702127659574468,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0425531914893617,0.02127659574468085,0.02127659574468085,0.0,0.5531914893617021,NaN,0.2267536704730832,0.0,0,0.0,616,45.96,60.26,25.48,18.58,13.39,25.00,87.99,50.97,11.04,4.87,0.49,1.79,0.97,0.16,1.46,6.17,6.33,10.23,12.01,3.73,8.12,3.57,17.21,4.22,2.60,1.79,0.49,2.76,5.03,2.27,2.76,0.16,0.32,0.32,9.25,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.16,19.81,4.71,2.76,2.44,3.73,3.08,5.36,1.46,0.97,0.00,0.32,1.30,0.49,0.32,0.32,0.49,6.98,2.11,0.81,2.27,0.16,1.79,3.90,10.23,1.62,9.09,0.97,4.55,3.73,3.25,0.00,0.00,0.00,4.06,0.32,0.97,0.00,0.00,0.32,0.00,0.00,20.94,6.82,5.03,0.49,0.00,1.14,0.00,0.49,0.65,1.14,3.25,1.95

t3_30dwuy,"i am someone who has personally met and spoken with ted cruz on a handful of occasions working up here in dc, starting as far back in 2012 when he was running for the senate seat. i can tell you he genuinely believes in all the things he stands for. what is a calculated persona is ""senator"" ted cruz. by which i mean he plays the room he is in. he is a pretty cunning orator like him or hate him. he is extremely shrewd and knows exactly how to play the jazz of politics. he knows what runs in the headlines. he knows what plays to his base. he punches way outside his weight class and it is paying off. think about what he has actually accomplished outside of rhetoric. outside of his speaking and sabre rattling there really nothing tangible he has to show for. sure he has introduced bills and made motions on the floor but to what end. political headlines and thats about it. his obamacare efforts are by large are entirely political theater and is not seriously doing any of the back channel to work to change any of the regulations he opposes. he knows this. and yet when people think of ""anti-obamacare"" crusaders ted cruz is the first name that pops into their heads. he continually makes click-bait level soliloquies that ultimately amount to a youtube highlight reel of bashing all the ""evil all star team"" of democrats and bureaucrats. it helps him in two ways. by making it look like he has busy fighting hard for republicans, it allows most americans who barely follow any legislative matters to believe he is the hardest working junior senator in this town. the second boon is he get's to be demonized by the left which raises his profile even higher. he has rebranded his ideas twice in 3 years by changing absolutely nothing in his positions. when he was running he championed himself as a liberty first tea party republican cut from ron paul's ilk. (a political point many around the paul and liberty wing didn't believe to be genuine). he talked about freeing americans from tyranny and oppression from federal over reach, all while quoting jefferson, madison, and patrick henry. it won huge dividends. in that last 12 months he has championed himself a fighter for those conservative values that under constant attack from both the government as well as left extremists seeking to erode traditional values. but what has he changed in his policy positions? nothing. people just bought his stump speeches right up. he is constantly underestimated. just ask the guy who spent 20 million too little too late trying beat him while ted only spent 7 million. that almost never happens in todays elections. remember barack obama buzz level in 2004-2007. outside of that amazing dnc speech he really went under the radar till 2007 when he burst onto the scene. they both are in a similar meteoric rise but taking completely different approaches. ted cruz went from an absolute nobody in politics to arguably the most recognizable republican faces in 2015 and he did through a crazy mix machiavellian planning and frank underwood jazz. i do not know how many times people are going to be caught with their pants down underestimating ted cruz before they wise up. does he really believe in all his policies and positions? absolutely. but he has not here to be a statesmen and to legislate. he has here to advance his agenda. he has not here to do what statesmen do; make concessions and build coalitions. he has wants to do whatever it takes to get his ideas and his face to the next level, and if you look at what he has done he makes underwood look like schoolboy in the political arena. that should scare everybody. sure he has a long shot by far, but he has been in this spot before and it is kind of his political m.o. tl;dr: ted cruz is a serious candidate. he believes in what he says, but he knows how to say it to get you to notice. it scares the republican party. it fires up the base. his chances are quite slim, but he has been manipulating the media to his advantage and it is working. whether that streak can stand on a national stage, we will have to wait and see. caveat: i do not like ted cruz. i think he has the archetype of a fake smile in a nice suit and a wolf and sheep's clothing. but he has not stupid, he has incredibly smart. but fuck him he has a politician and if that does not already make him a dick he stands for some real bullshit.",cprwysn,461.61207792539847,1,1427439040,51,17,23398,0,67.58498730964467,788.0,1164.0,56.0,1,0.017857142857142856,0.0,0.17857142857142858,0.21428571428571427,0.0,0.0,0.05357142857142857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017857142857142856,0.0,0.05357142857142857,0.0,0.5357142857142857,0.004958677685950413,0.2906091370558376,0.0,0,0.0,799,56.32,78.48,5.25,49.03,14.53,19.65,83.23,54.32,16.27,10.64,0.75,0.13,0.38,8.89,0.50,5.63,5.51,13.77,8.01,5.26,6.51,1.50,16.02,4.88,1.88,2.88,2.00,2.13,5.01,3.13,1.88,0.25,0.88,0.00,13.14,0.00,0.13,0.00,9.14,12.02,2.88,1.75,0.50,2.00,2.38,3.13,2.00,0.63,0.88,0.50,1.00,0.50,0.13,0.25,0.25,7.63,0.88,2.13,4.51,1.00,0.00,2.88,12.02,0.50,13.89,1.88,8.51,3.88,3.50,1.63,0.13,0.75,0.13,0.00,0.88,0.38,0.13,0.25,0.13,0.00,10.76,6.76,1.38,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.00,0.38,0.75,0.50,0.25,0.00

t3_2woffm,"i administer and interpret iq tests on a regular basis. as others have stated, i find your stance somewhat imprecise, as your original post seems to be a bit long-winded and jumpy, no offense. but it sounds like these were the main points you were arguing for: * iq tests are fairly crude and potentially invalid measures of intelligence/ability; * other measures such as gpa and standardized tests such as act/gre are similarly inadequate in fully capturing the ""whole"" student, * using a combination of these measures is the best thing we can do, but they still fail to take into account other factors such as effort, cultural upbringing, attendance, etc. therefore, they are a necessary evil. i'll try to address your concerns the best i can, but this is a pretty complex issue, well beyond the scope of a reddit post or two. i will give you the tldr of how i would respond to your concerns: * intelligence tests have strong predictive power of academic achievement--in other words, we can say with a reasonable degree of confidence that those with higher iqs will do better in school than those with lower iqs. however, this is not always the case: when someone with a higher iq is under-performing in school, however, it could be due to a number of reasons-- poor instruction and classroom management, lack of effort, poor attendance, cultural and linguistic barriers, challenging home life, or a learning disability (again, probably beyond the scope of this post, but individuals with learning disabilities actually typically have a reasonably average/high iq, but still under-perform in school). these examples i mentioned, however, are more the exception than the rule. in other words, more often than not, iq tests *can* predict performance in school. for the sake of full disclosure, i believe there are other measures that are probably superior predictors of school performance than iq tests (coming to a school near you! maybe.), but that's another story for another day. * the same argument applies for the other measures you mentioned, such as gpa, and sat/act/gre standardized scores, which (allegedly) have strong predictive power. high school gpa is a strong predictor of college gpa, for example. i threw in the word allegedly earlier, because there is some research that suggests that some standardized tests such as the gre are a bit more dubious in their validity. i know there are some graduate programs that no longer require gre scores for this reason. but in general, the laundry list of things that colleges require are predictive of academic performance. * i listed some barriers to academic achievement above--poor instruction and classroom management, lack of effort, poor attendance, cultural and linguistic barriers, challenging home life, or a learning disability, to name some of the big ones. and you are correct, such factors can completely diminish how one might look ""on paper."" these are tremendous challenges in the field of education. anyone who enters the field of education is almost certainly aware of these factors. addressing these issues is beyond the scope of this post, but all i can say is that, yes, we are aware of these issues, and every day there is a growing body of research that is helping us tackle them. and we are making progress. very, very slow progress, but progress. * there are more qualitative aspects to admissions processes, such as your resume, personal statement, letters of recommendation, and face-to-face interview. there are cases where having a strong background in a particular area or a memorable interview may trump a specific gpa. and honestly, after college, basically no one cares about or asks what gpa you had. * ""you keep bringing up academic performance. grades are not everything."" yeah, you are right. but higher education is in ever-growing demand in modern society, so, yes, we want to hire people who pass college and graduate school and have their degrees to show for it.

t3_3814fe,"i think you are under the misconception that logical fallacies are pieces of rhetoric that are frowned upon because they are ineffective. it's the opposite. logical fallacies are extremely potent to the uneducated listener on a certain subject, or to those not thinking critically about what is being said. the reason they are frowned upon is because they are manipulative, irrelevant, or inflammatory by design. they do not offer a platform for healthy discussion, but rather try to make things much more one-sided than they probably are in reality. so, even if you think ""buckle up, it is the law"" is a logical fallacy, to say because it is a logical fallacy it is ineffective is a complete misunderstanding of the disdain for shady rhetorical practices such as these. moving on, this is not really an appeal to authority. an appeal to authority usually implies that a figure with authority has the credibility necessary to back up a claim even though their authority may have absolutely no relevance to what is being talked about. for example, if we are talking about what is our favorite type of sandwich and i go ""president obama's favorite sandwich is pb&j, so that's obviously the superior sandwich"" then i have just made an appeal to authority. president obama is an important man, he commands a lot of authority through his title and is a widely recognized name. but who cares if he likes pb&j and when did anyone make him the expert on sandwiches? the crux of what you are trying to say is that you think the bodily harm and safety concerns for those in vehicles with people not buckled up would prove more effective deterrents. while i can't say definitively one way or the other, the people who thought up that slogan were advertising professionals most likely. it is snappy, easy to remember, and has weight to it. also, monetary concerns are something that anybody and everybody can understand in an instant. bodily harm, though? a lot of people think they are invincible, or simply refuse to recognize their own mortality as it is a scary thought. especially when the thought includes dying in a bloody mess because you weren't wearing your seatbelt.",crrmt1x,134.01861665726724,1,1433171117,151,42,17438,0,46.35892707397426,371.0,612.0,18.0,3,0.05555555555555555,0.0,0.16666666666666666,0.2222222222222222,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.0,0.1111111111111111,0.05555555555555555,0.05555555555555555,0.0,0.0,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.8333333333333335,0.06458737341090283,0.2560646900269542,0.0,0,0.0,374,48.22,64.60,27.32,45.41,20.78,24.87,88.24,58.82,14.44,6.42,1.07,0.53,1.60,1.07,2.14,8.02,8.29,12.57,11.50,6.15,8.02,1.87,18.45,3.48,1.60,2.14,0.53,1.87,4.28,2.67,1.60,0.27,0.00,0.00,10.70,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.34,19.79,5.61,2.94,1.34,5.08,2.67,5.88,1.60,0.00,1.34,0.27,2.67,1.07,0.27,0.00,1.34,7.49,0.53,2.94,5.35,0.00,0.27,1.87,14.17,0.53,7.22,0.53,5.08,1.87,2.14,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.53,0.53,0.27,0.00,0.27,0.00,0.00,12.57,4.28,4.55,0.00,0.00,0.53,0.00,0.27,1.07,1.34,0.00,0.53

t3_2yg8n4,"we actually have touched upon this in every term of my asl class, as the culture of deaf people is related to the learning of sign language. there are several reasons parents choose to not get cochlear implants, and the reasons vary depending on whether the parents are hearing, were born deaf, or became deaf after birth/no genetic component to deafness. but before i begin, i want to mention that not everyone is a candidate for cochlear implants, so just because a deaf person/child does not have an implant does not mean they/their parents didn't want it. i am also going to assume we are only talking about english, so i will only refer to american sign language when it is mentioned. one of the reasons, regardless of parentage, is the fact that cochlear implants destroy the hair cells in your ears that cause hearing people to hear - [it sounds like this.] (this means that if, in the future, an actual cure to deafness was discovered that allowed some deaf people to hear the same as a non deaf person, they would be unable to, because their hair cells are obliterated by the procedure. that point aside, think of a non-deaf child - you just talk to him/her and they eventually pick up the language, right? a child with a cochlear implant need *lots* of speech therapy to make sure they are understanding and pronouncing words correctly since, as you heard from the youtube clip, it is not exactly the same as actual hearing. these children also have not been listening to their parents beforehand, which, even though they can't understand, does help development of language. and if you listen to the music part of that clip, it may prove harder for a child/anyone, really, to distinguish sounds/voices/subtleties from different people talking at the same time, such as a crowded room. in addition to this, children with cochlear implants need to be talked to a lot more than hearing children because their ""hearing"" is much different. so hearing parents would be able to do this extra talking, but most deaf parents probably can't - the fact that they can't fully commit to their child's development of speech is essentially disabling them developmentally, which is not really fair to the child. in addition, the costs for the speech therapy could be quite high depending on whether they have insurance that would cover it/any insurance at all. the same goes for the actual implant, which, according to wikipedia, [can cost between 45,000 and 125,000 dollars] (most deaf parents who do not choose to get the implant just teach their children sign language. it can be learned [much earlier than speech and used for effective communication] (it is essentially just another language, albeit one that most people do not know. most else of what i would say would mirror what /u/mckoijion wrote - the deaf parents have just chosen a different path for their child, one that they can change when they are older. also similar to /u/mahjongk, this is normal for deaf people - why are they being forced to follow the majority just because they dictate what is ""normal""? also, to address your >even if a deaf person opts into an implant later in life, they have missed a time of formative cognitive development, and their brain will never be as good at processing audial input as it would have been if they had been hearing from a young age. i would argue that based on the above youtube clip, it may be easier for (edit) a child with deaf parents* to process the new audial language as an adult, similar to an adult learning chinese when their native language is english. since children who get the implants need so much extra therapy that it may impede their ability to learn english, it may just be easier to learn the language of asl as a child and then apply that as an adult to learn to speak english (they also already know how to write/read it, which is a plus). ~~it also may be better for them to start to ""hear"" when they are adults - it could be a pretty big shock as an infant to suddenly be able to hear when you had not before, and then use that tool which you are not really comfortable with to learn a whole language.~~ ** hope this helps! **here, so there is less comments i have to answer about the same thing, in a child comment it was discussed that if a child does not utilize their auditory cortex via a cochlear implant early in life, the auditory cortex's function would atrophy and be re-purposed for other functions, meaning future hearing/speech as an adult could be impaired. a solution to this for children with deaf parents would be to get the cochlear implant to prevent this from happening but still teach them asl and hire a nanny/family member to dedicate their time to teach them how to hear/speak. regardless, the child may not be a candidate or the family may not have the money/resources to make the implant viable.",cp9bef9,1370.6972941063073,1,1425926899,257,17,7344,0,50.301941176470606,850.0,1226.0,25.0,4,0.32,0.0,0.16,0.32,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04,0.0,0.0,0.08,0.0,0.2,0.0,1.12,0.0645914849039849,0.20470588235294118,0.0,0,0.0,871,62.41,82.09,10.38,37.98,36.29,19.63,88.98,55.57,12.51,5.97,0.92,0.23,1.03,0.23,3.56,6.54,7.69,14.12,10.33,5.74,7.00,2.30,16.53,5.97,4.71,2.30,0.80,2.53,1.61,1.15,0.46,0.00,0.23,0.11,16.07,1.61,0.00,0.11,0.11,16.53,3.33,3.10,2.87,3.56,1.26,4.94,5.40,0.00,5.17,0.23,2.64,0.23,2.41,0.00,0.00,7.35,2.18,0.80,3.67,0.80,0.11,2.18,11.83,1.84,7.35,0.46,2.87,4.02,2.41,0.57,0.57,0.69,0.00,0.00,0.23,0.00,0.23,0.00,0.00,0.00,15.61,2.53,5.63,0.00,0.00,0.23,0.11,0.92,0.69,0.69,0.80,4.02

t3_32jy1s,">i'm not sure i disagree with the courts' decisions rationally because they weighed the circumstances pretty solidly, except maybe i do not see how there can be any objection to the woman, with full custody, retaining control over the nature of the visitation with her kids visitation rights are not something the parent with custody has any control over. it is a legal decree by the court that is followed by the parents. she has to petition the court because moving affects the children's well being and visitation rights with the other parent are part of that. >nor do i understand how the fact that the father could not afford to keep up visitation in another state should become the mother's burden especially when she is willing to help fund the continued visitation; being able to afford visitation is part of it, yes, but there are other logistical problems with a move to another state. even if both parents had unlimited money to spend on travel expenses, the mother's proposed new schedule would drastically reduce the time the children spent with their father by reducing the total time and frequency they saw their father (loss of wednesday nights and first refusal rights plus the travel time),and give the mother too much control over potential visitation time. >and finally also why they didn't factor in the reduced visitation sending the eldest child to a boarding institution might cause on all parties i would imagine because it effects all parties. >personally i think her actual mistake was asking the courts for permission and trying to work out an arrangement. courts tend to take court orders pretty seriously. not following one is bad juju. here's the bulk of my post. i think the court opinion does the best job addressing your misgivings about why the courts should have control over this. the mother has to prove to the court that the move would be in the best interests of the children. the court has to address what they call eckert factors when making a decision about removal while looking at the evidence of the case. the appellate court has to make sure the trial court adequately looked at those factors. the factors, plus what the court found for each one is below >(1.) the likelihood the move will enhance quality of life for both the custodial parent and the children. the court was ""not convinced"" that the lives of the children would be enhanced by the move. scholastically, there was no evidence that nj schools were any better than il schools. the mother wouldn't be able to spend more time with the children (the evidence pointed to less, plus that time could not be spent with their father), the home life they were moving to was equivalent to the home in il (except again, logistically they would spend less time with the father), etc. essentially, the only improvement without a major downside for the children or the father was that the mother would be making more money, but the court found that the children were adequately cared for under her previous salary so the move was not necessary. the court determined that this factor ruled against removal and the appellate court found it to be consistent with the evidence presented. > (2.) the motives of the custodial parent in seeking removal and whether it is merely a ruse to frustrate visitation the court thought that the mother wanted complete control of the children regardless of the father's inputs or rights based on the testimony presented. i will not go through it all, but the court found that the father would only be further marginalized if the move were allowed. the appellate court found that the trial court was in the best position to determine that and they have no basis to overturn the assessment. > (3.) the motives of the noncustodial parent in resisting removal the court found that james had genuine reasons to resist the removal, and the mother didn't contest this at all. since the mother could not contest that point the court weighed against removal. >(4.) the effect of the move on the noncustodial parent's visitation rights the mother tried to prove that they could maintain a visitation schedule that was reasonably similar to the current one. the court found that assertion was not borne out of evidence. the children would lose wednesday nights with the father, times where they would be with him because of first refusal rights, time lost to travel, etc. there was no way her proposed schedule would equal the quantity and quality of time the children spent with their father. the trial court agreed, and the appellate court thought the evidence was consistent with their decision. >(5.) ; and whether a realistic and reasonable visitation schedule can be reached if the court allows removal the trial court said the mother did not appear willing to work with the father to maintain regular visitation. the court was worried that the move to nj would give the mother too much control over the children and visitation, which they already found that she wanted to control the children's lives and their interactions with the father (for example, the father could sit in the waiting room when one of their children was in the hospital, but could not be in the room with them). since her proposed visitation schedule was so unreasonable the court didn't think she seriously wanted to work out a reasonable one. it is stated that the court realizes that a change in the visitation schedule might be warranted if it is best for the children, but the court found that the children's lives wouldn't be improved by the move and that it would only hurt their relationship with the father. in short, the court needed to decide that the move was what was best for the children to approve it, they factor in the parent's rights too, but the children are the main thing. there was not sufficient evidence in this particular case that removal was best for the children because the mother didn't prove that it would increase the children's quality of life when all factors (including visitation with their father) are considered. once you have kids with someone, you are tying yourselves to them because you both are obligated (sometimes by the courts) to put your children first. sometimes it is best to have sole or joint custody. sometimes it is best to have or not have visitation. but if you have kids, seperate, and force the courts to become involved in deciding what is best for your children, you need to involve the court in major decisions that would alter the agreement you, your partner, *and* the courts are now part of, especially if it hurts one of the parties involved like this situation does.",cqc7xo9,4057.5845871033334,1,1429038879,317,33,-2570,0,54.07356338717574,1135.0,1706.0,45.0,2,0.08888888888888889,0.0,0.15555555555555556,0.3111111111111111,0.0,0.044444444444444446,0.044444444444444446,0.06666666666666667,0.0,0.022222222222222223,0.022222222222222223,0.044444444444444446,0.022222222222222223,0.044444444444444446,0.8666666666666666,0.12395896512875124,0.16916299559471365,0.0,0,0.0,1141,86.73,68.50,18.41,45.07,25.36,22.35,85.10,54.25,9.90,4.56,0.79,0.00,0.96,0.88,1.93,5.35,12.80,12.88,9.90,3.33,5.17,2.28,16.83,2.54,1.84,1.40,1.31,2.19,3.68,2.28,1.23,0.09,0.09,0.44,11.04,3.24,0.09,2.02,1.40,16.91,4.29,3.68,3.33,2.54,1.40,4.12,0.70,0.44,0.09,0.18,0.79,0.00,0.61,0.00,0.18,9.11,1.40,2.72,5.08,1.40,0.44,4.91,8.59,0.44,10.60,2.63,4.12,3.77,1.58,0.53,0.44,0.96,0.00,0.00,0.18,0.00,0.00,0.09,0.09,0.00,11.83,3.94,3.07,0.00,0.18,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.18,1.58,1.93,0.96

t3_39sviv,"first off, your argument is fundamentally problematic in that you assume only one weapon is being brought. obviously the best is not to *just* use the sword or spear or whatever, but to bring both, multiple of many, outfitting different parts of your army with different equipment sets. to clearly set the boundaries of the argument to avoid this issue, let us assume that for this discussion you can *only bring one weapon.* with that in mind, none of us can prove that a sword or an axe is better than a spear in every situation. these weapon types were used together because they are good in different situations. thus, i will attempt to show how though a spear may have myriad isolated scenarios where it is the best choice, there are so many more scenarios where other weapons are better that if you were forced to bring only one to some unknown pre-firearm combat (gladiator fights, warfare, whatever), some form of sword would be better. >its cheap to make compared to its counterparts correct, but this also means it breaks more easily. and due to its size, even a small spear is much more likely to break along the shaft as you are transporting it. medieval warfare is just as much about getting to the battle without losing equipment or soldiers as it is winning the battle once you are there. a spear that has been damaged in transport is almost unusable, as any bend along the shaft past the gripping point is disastrous for melee combat, and any bend at all will ruin the balance for throwing. these bends happen *very easily*, and they are a natural consequence of the design. sometimes it is even intentional. this is the reason good armies often outfitted soldiers with multiple spears. but we can only bring one, so the spear loses out here compared to a weapon that's easier to carry, easier to store, harder to break, and can be sheathed. >its reach is longer than any non pole arm weapon. only for two-handed spears, and those sacrifice the use of a shield and are still a death sentence if the opponent can make it past your spear-point (trivial to do if the opponent has a shield). so let us discard two-handed polearms in general; they have a good niche for battlefield use, but without a dedicated (and disciplined) unbreaking formation or other niche battlefield scenarios, at some point the enemy will make it past your weapon-point and you will be doomed. contrast with a [longsword (which has as much reach as any one-handed spear, can be used one-handed (though a bit awkwardly) along with a shield if need be, has the weight to knock enemy shields aside and knock armored opponents off their horses (something a spear can only do easily if you manage to penetrate their armor) and remains useful at least for defense (although less than a shorter sword) when the enemy passes by your maximum reach, something no kind of spear can manage (parrying with the shaft of your spear is a great way to permanently break it and leave you with *zero* weapons to defend yourself). so if reach is all you want, take a longsword. >its strikes can create enough power to penetrate most armor. so can large or small swords. plate armor was not used until nearly the end of the medieval period, and most soldiers were simply farmers with a helmet on their head, boots on their feet, and some kind of armor on their torso. nothing on their upper arm, usually. spears handle torso armor poorly; they can't bash effectively, and they can't target limbs or necks as easily as a slashing weapon can, so in most battlefield scenarios (where the torso is armored and the limbs are less armored) they are at a significant disadvantage. besides, this point is wrong in general. in a pitched battle, hitting a small chink in armor with the single point of your spear (past their shield, usually) is almost impossible. spears hold no significant advantage in this regard over any other weapon. if you want to penetrate armor, [daggers are much better because their short length allows you much better point control](>with the advent of protective plate armour during the middle ages, the dagger became increasingly useful as a good close in weapon for stabbing through the gaps in armour. books offering instruction on the use of weapons described the dagger being held in the hand with the blade pointing from the heel of the hand and used to make downward jabs. straight jabs from a normal hammer grip were also used, though icepick style jabs are more commonly depicted in manuals. so spears have no significant advantage here and in general are actually *less* effective against armored foes than most other weapons. >it can be turned into a projectile yes, but as [polybius points out](spears that are used as ranged weapons are best when constructed so that they are *only* usable as a ranged weapon. and when a spear is your only weapon (as we have decided), throwing your spear at the opponent is an *incredibly idiotic move*. if you do not win the fight with that one blow alone, you will never get your spear back (hell, if it is a good enough weapon to be still in-tact then the enemy has it now!), and you are doomed to die. so while this is a great reason that the spear is a fantastic supplemental weapon, it provides no reason to pick a spear *as your only weapon* in almost any kind of battle. >its light and fast not as light or fast as a shortsword. moving on. >its great against cavalry. only when that cavalry is lightly armored. if they are well-armored, a longsword or other long and heavy swinging weapons are much better because they do not have to injure the fighter to knock them off their horse. besides, cavalry is not fought off in a pre-firearm battle by killing them all anyways. cavalry is naturally limited in numbers due to a reliance on mounts. they are not used to slaughter fields of infantry, they are used to *harry* fields of infantry. mounts are scary, and cavalry are best used when they are mostly just scaring the opponent's (likely poorly trained, tired, hungry, and scared) infantry into a disadvantageous position. even if your army was so skilled with a spear as to be able to kill all the enemy cavalry, killing cavalry does not win a battle; forcing the enemy infantry into retreat wins the battle, and if you have outfitted all your army with just spears you will have issues against the infantry for reasons i have already stated or will point out later. so though this point is somewhat accurate in certain time periods, it is hardly enough to carry the argument. >the only downsides i can think of are that it is inconvenient to carry around compared to a sword or dagger, and that it might be hard to use in very tight spaces. this is your main problem. you are correct in that those *are* key downsides to spear use. you are incorrect in assuming that those are anything less than * **huge fucking problems** *. pre-modern warfare is all about motion. not on the battlefield; but the motion involved in *reaching* the battlefield. most battles were decided before the battle even started. if your infantry is low on morale (because they are a poor, hungry, untrained farmer militia, usually) and they break ranks when the enemy looks threatening, the battle is probably over. that's when most casualties of battle occured in the pre-modern day anyways; when one side is fleeing with their backs turned. morale is just one casualty of long marches, though; equipment is another. check out that polybius link in detail and you will see what i mean. the roman army was not successful because they had just fantastic soldiers. they were successful because they recognized that the lead-up to the battle is more important than the battle, and maintaining equipment, discipline, morale, and camp was what mattered. for this reason, the fact that the spear is easier to break and more inconvenient to carry is a *huge downside*. any spear large enough that it cannot be carried with your other gear and must be held will weigh heavily on the minds and morale of your forces when they march. having to account for your long, clunky spear as you make camp (and good armies make meticulous camp) is hard and stressful. and this is all assuming that your spear does not break during transit, which it can do very easily because there is a *lot* of transit and it is not anywhere as easy as you might imagine in the modern day. marches (which can be as long as weeks at a time) are *fucking brutal,* especially when you have to try and make sure your poorly constructed spear does not snap or bend at all during that time. if you do not have a weapon with you that's more sturdy, that's a *huge* problem. and now, tight spaces. again, you severely underestimate this downside. tight spaces *are the rule* of infantry vs. infantry engagements on any large scale. armies run at each other, use their ranged weapons, poke for a bit, and then charge at each other with their shields and get locked into a big crowd. they are almost inevitable. this is the time when any army that has any idea what it is doing drops its spears and pulls out its shorter weapons (most notable, some kind of sword). and if your army only has spears, well... this is when your army gets slaughtered, loses their morale, flees (despite your orders as a leader) and gets slaughtered even harder. in the end, you are correct that the spear is *very* useful, but mainly as a secondary or opening weapon combined with a shorter weapon like a sword. that's why that's how they have *always been used* since at least the time of the romans. they are great ranged weapons if you have another weapon. or great reach weapons if you have something smaller to handle the inevitable close-range engagement. but as your only weapon they are a *really bad idea*.",cs6gis7,2261.030152750794,1,1434342285,393,78,51445,0,61.18332849594674,1727.0,2526.0,80.0,2,0.1,0.025,0.1375,0.175,0.0,0.0125,0.025,0.0125,0.0375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0625,0.0,0.5875,0.07835633799732446,0.18587145338737696,0.0,0,0.0,1739,57.42,64.80,28.84,1.45,22.58,17.19,83.15,53.59,11.33,5.69,0.23,0.29,3.05,0.00,2.13,5.64,7.25,12.65,10.24,6.04,8.68,1.50,13.86,7.36,4.66,1.50,0.86,3.74,8.97,2.93,6.04,0.35,4.26,0.52,7.42,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,14.20,1.38,2.99,1.67,5.12,1.55,5.00,1.09,0.35,0.00,0.75,0.92,0.52,0.12,0.12,0.23,7.88,0.35,1.73,4.54,2.01,1.21,2.24,11.27,0.81,12.71,1.67,7.07,3.80,0.52,0.06,0.00,0.40,0.23,0.75,0.52,0.23,0.00,0.06,0.12,0.12,16.45,4.66,4.66,0.00,0.35,0.00,0.06,0.81,0.00,0.52,2.13,3.28

t3_2zpo9g,"> the reason i currently believe this would be successful is i sense that congress is over-burdened by the weight of tradition and even distracted by it. it is likely to me there are plenty of visionary freshmen, and even visionary candidates, with excellent ideas to help ease gridlock and make efficient progress again, but under the weight of the current institution i propose that it is nearly impossible for this to happen. this is true, but (1) that's part of the design, and (2) there are easier ways to fix it. if you want an examination of congressional gridlock in historical context, pick up robert caro's *master of the senate*, about the senate career of lyndon johnson. it explains, in a lengthy prologue, how and why the senate is a dead weight that inhibits progress or indeed most useful legislation. senatorial intrasigence was a ""feature"" to the founding generation -- not a bug. there are certainly reasons to second-guess that determination today. and there have been for centuries: senatorial delays kept the poor poor during the gilded era, kept blacks from meaningfully exercising their right to vote until 1965, and arguably left america under-prepared for world war ii. so let us say i agree with your goal -- making the congress more responsive and efficient is a good thing to strive for. it does not follow, though, that a ""reboot"" is the way to do it. first, as [i and others have told you](it is patently unconstitutional. second, new blood is not necessarily good blood. a ""clean-slate"" congress could just as easily devolve into power jockeying. third, given the way districts are drawn, new blood probably *wouldn't be* different blood. house races are [basically ""rigged"" to be noncompetitive](for every extremist you would kick out with a ""clean slate"" rule, you would likely just get a similar extremist, but one without the experience and expertise that (sometimes) comes with seniority. if gerrymandering is not to blame -- and some well-regarded left-leaning think tanks [make that case](-- then shifts towards the ""nationalizing"" of local races, and the eradication of cross-cutting cleavages, **are**. let me explain that last part. until about 1980, social conservatism and fiscal conservatism did not necessarily go hand-in-hand. you would see congressmen who were hostile (or at least apathetic to) civil rights -- like sam rayburn -- but who were fire-breathing anti-business *conservatives*. those issues no longer cut *across* the ideological spectrum: now, if you are a social conservative, you are likely also anti-business regulation. all of this means candidates benefit from reinforcing prejudices, especially where money is involved,^[*] and as a result, congress is going to end up reducing to extremist, warring factions, term limits or ""reboot"" notwithstanding. worse still, by throwing ""the baby out with the bathwater"" and purging the whole congress, you would get rid of the few experienced, highly-effective representatives who actually can cut across ideologies. for every tom cotton you would lose, you would also lose a chuck schumer. institutional ""brain drain"" is hardly likely to result in a better legislative process. i do not mean to make this problem sound unsolvable. it *is* solvable, but the solution is difficult. that solution is, *just elect better people goddamn it!!!!!!* to go back to caro and lyndon johnson, during lbj's tenure as senate majority leader, shit got done. it might not've always been good shit, but that shit *did get done*, in large part because lbj's overriding ambition always trumped political causes for him. toss out divisive ideologues -- who are mostly ineffective -- and elect good legislators. that will solve the problem. it also might be the only solution.

t3_2zpo9g,"here is why you are wrong: the problem with congress is not the people. it is the era, context and circumstances into which they are elected. let me explain. congress is dysfunctional for three main reasons: 1. money. campaign contributions and lobbyists having the freedom they do guarantees that the will of the people will be minimized and it encourages politicians in both parties to cater much more to a small contingent of monied ""supporters"". 2. gerrymandering. this allows representatives to be very safe in their bids for reelection and even when challenged, it typically means they have to move farther left or right--not toward the center--to appeal to their very left/right wing districts. 3. both the executive and legislative branch are always up for grabs. this is unique and underestimated. look at the chart below: what it shows is that the last thirty years in us politics are unique in that either party has a very realistic shot of regaining control of the white house or congress in any given election. previously you had long streaks of republican or democratic control of the legislative or executive branch. why is this important? because neither party is willing to submit or give an inch when they literally may be inches away from gaining/losing a branch of our federal government. to compromise is to concede certain points. conceding certain points can be a concession of power. concessions of power are much more likely when there is an established control of the process. people talk about when reagan and tip o'neill compromised in the 80's. this is because they each had to: the republicans had no shot at the house so to get anything done they had to concede and democrats had no shot at the white house so to get anything done they had to concede. so you can ""shake things up"" if you want but until something changes with the above-mentioned issues, the gridlock will remain.",cplrjw9,183.69366653970704,1,1426915864,175,29,44014,0,58.51076792772446,322.0,508.0,22.0,2,0.0,0.0,0.09090909090909091,0.22727272727272727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3181818181818182,0.03461538461538462,0.2795031055900621,0.0,0,0.0,332,68.24,67.42,20.07,65.71,15.09,21.99,82.53,55.12,9.94,4.82,0.30,0.60,1.20,0.00,2.71,5.12,7.53,14.46,11.75,5.12,7.53,1.51,15.36,4.52,2.11,2.41,1.81,2.71,4.82,3.31,1.20,0.30,0.00,0.30,7.83,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,11.14,0.90,3.01,0.90,4.22,1.20,3.31,1.51,1.20,0.00,0.30,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,11.75,2.41,0.90,6.63,1.20,1.20,3.61,10.24,1.20,12.35,0.90,8.43,3.01,2.71,0.90,0.90,0.30,0.00,0.00,0.30,0.00,0.30,0.00,0.00,0.00,12.65,6.33,0.90,1.20,0.00,0.30,0.00,1.51,1.20,0.60,0.00,0.60

t3_3gp6g1,"i think there is a fundamental problem with your premise. if you look at how the war started, you will see more issues with us involvement. the us acted as an aggressor. they transformed a struggle that was essentially anti-colonialist (which they should have supported, based on their propaganda about freedom and shit), into a war-of-the-worlds-anti-communist struggle. they supported a corrupt government in the south (just like in korea before the war there), which had no legitimacy, no credit, and no real power. why do you think the viet cong was so successful? poor people hated that government. (just like in korea, by the way...) they also lied about an incident to get involved in the actual war (gulf of tonkin), and then they proceeded to massacre between 2 to 4 million of your countryfellows, bombed laos and cambodia, and enabled the khmer rouge to commit their own atrocities. had the us not interfered in the original struggle against the french, there would probably not have been chinese/russian involvement in the same extent. the domino theory was a paranoid delusion, and it caused immense suffering to your country. as for which overlords are better? look at latin america, if you want to see what life under us influence is. (well, was.) look at nicaragua, columbia, el salvador, chile, etc... not nice places to live (and die, unless you like being thrown out of airplanes, or killed for demanding 10cent more for the hourly wage of banana pickers). the commies were not much better, either (i grew up in central europe on the other side of the iron curtain), but they at least took some social issues seriously, and invested in education, healthcare and other stuff, which were somewhat beneficial, even if it was stupid at times, like pushing for heavy industry in agricultural countries. (just look how afghanistan looked like in the 70s...) the us involvement was wrong both morally and legally. from there it makes no difference what the outcome would have been; but if you really want to think about it, you might want to look at south korea on the bright side, or the philippines, latin america on the dark side. an almost fascist dictatorship slowly transforming into a (relative) democracy vs a banana republic plagued by corruption, coups and death squads.",cu0aq54,349.5563298599398,1,1439387082,154,17,17298,0,55.12803307223675,383.0,603.0,21.0,1,0.09523809523809523,0.0,0.09523809523809523,0.42857142857142855,0.047619047619047616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047619047619047616,0.0,0.7142857142857144,0.0,0.3368146214099217,0.0,0,0.0,392,83.91,64.91,20.57,7.85,18.67,21.17,82.91,53.57,10.20,6.38,0.51,1.28,2.55,0.00,2.04,3.83,8.67,16.07,6.38,5.87,6.89,2.04,13.52,4.85,3.83,2.30,0.77,2.04,8.16,3.32,4.85,1.02,2.55,0.26,7.91,0.00,0.26,0.00,0.00,11.99,0.77,2.30,2.81,3.06,0.51,5.10,2.81,2.55,0.00,0.26,1.28,0.26,0.51,0.00,0.51,8.42,2.04,1.02,4.34,1.28,0.51,5.36,6.63,0.77,12.50,1.02,9.44,2.04,2.30,0.00,0.26,1.02,0.00,2.30,0.51,0.26,0.00,0.00,0.26,0.00,21.43,6.38,7.91,0.00,0.26,0.51,0.00,1.53,0.00,0.00,4.59,0.26

""decades of research clearly demonstrate that bridge barriers effectively prevent suicides (e.g., beautrais, 2007; o?carroll & silverman, 1994)."" i think that the way you present suicide implies that all the people who commit suicide want to go and absolutely none are like the examples shown earlier. many people are ""talked down from the ledge"" and go on to live fruitful, healthy lives without another suicide attempts because they were able to get to the help they needed because of some preventative measure. you could argue that these cases are few but they are greater than 1. what if those barriers only ever save one life. would it be worth it? well, the way you present suicide you seem to imply that all the people who commit suicide definitely want to go. they have done the cost-benefit analysis and decided that suicide is the only way. if somebody, then, is committing suicide purely through ignorance of a cure at the time, your morality should dictate that we should do everything in our power to stop that person from jumping. or at least delay their attempt until they have done the cost-benefit analysis and realised jumping is the best way to go. if you do not want to view barriers as a suicide-prevention device, then look at them as a way for delaying an impulsive jumper's attempt until they have made a fully-informed decision. i think under those circumstances there presence on bridges is acceptable.",croli1i,434.35312441449287,1,1432888808,35,9,12169,0,63.17207469775478,386.0,581.0,24.0,1,0.0,0.0,0.20833333333333334,0.5416666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.125,0.0,0.9166666666666666,0.07758799171842651,0.20466321243523317,0.0,0,0.0,397,59.51,74.38,27.32,68.55,18.90,22.67,90.68,56.93,14.11,6.30,0.76,0.50,1.51,1.01,2.52,7.81,7.56,13.35,10.33,5.29,6.30,2.02,18.39,2.77,2.27,1.26,1.26,2.27,3.78,3.02,0.76,0.00,0.25,0.25,11.59,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.26,19.14,4.79,2.52,4.03,3.02,4.28,4.28,0.76,0.50,0.00,0.00,1.76,0.00,1.51,0.00,0.25,6.30,0.76,1.01,3.27,1.51,1.01,3.78,13.60,0.50,12.59,2.02,6.55,4.03,1.51,0.00,0.00,0.76,0.25,3.27,1.01,0.00,0.25,0.50,0.25,0.00,15.11,5.54,3.27,0.00,0.25,0.50,0.00,1.26,1.51,0.50,1.01,1.26
t3_37us53,"op, i am going to address your issue with the arbitrary rule and hope it is worth a delta! i am really excited about my explanation, i hope it helps! god made man in his image, i am sure you heard this before. that does not mean we look like him or behave in the way he designed us to, it means that he made us like himself. that is a very important point. god has granted us free will, the power to choose our own eternal destinies. we have the power to create life and kill it. we can live how we want. this god-given free will let us us choose to live our lives the way we want, for good or for evil. now, in the garden of eden, we have a paradise where god has created two people with a default setting of an eternal, blissful life. they do not need to work, they will never die, they will not experience hardship. however! this situation by itself is not entirely fair because it leaves people with no way to choose their own destiny, to live without god, to choose evil. they have free will but not enough power and no method to exercise it. god created tree of knowledge of good and evil as a means for his creation to exercise their right to turn acquire enough knowledge and power to turn from him and become their own gods over themselves. eating the fruit of the tree grants people power, and power can be abused. it raises people up to be more like god in terms of agency over their own lives. accepting that power means you have to accept the responsibility that comes with it. god is no longer going to babysit you in eden. choosing to eat of the tree is seen as a sin because it is not the best choice for someone to make in order to live a happy life that honors god. it leads to power, yes, but it leads to pain and hardship and even more difficulty in maintaining a relationship with god. the tree must exist in order for us to have a door to leave eden if we want to, but that does not mean that going through that door is the right thing to do. god provided an opportunity for escape, despite how much i am sure he did not want us to take the route. to summarize my points: 1. having the tree available is necessary. in order to give us free will, god could not not put it there. like a yin yang, one side can't exist without a conduit to the other. our free will means nothing if god does not provide us a way to exercise it. 2. god kicked adam and eve out of eden because the tree granted them enough power and knowledge for them to live on their own, without god's constant aid. it is like having a teenager who demands to be treated like an adult and then cutting the apron strings and withdrawing some of your parent-y support. if they choose to go through life on their own terms, that's what they get. adam and eve chose not to listen to god and to go their own way, and that's what they got. they became their own gods, in a way. 3. eating from the tree is a sin because god wanted what is best for them, which is to live a long and happy life in eden where they can be together. the tree must exist, but it leads to hardship and sometimes separation from god. it is not the choice that is in his best interest for us. so i hope that gives a little clarity on why god had to put the tree there and how significant it was. let me know what you think!",crq57fh,1467.1054566092166,1,1433043887,665,66,13683,0,79.92742136785165,647.0,845.0,40.0,3,0.0,0.0,0.125,0.15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05,0.025,0.025,0.37500000000000006,0.04135985097523558,0.17465224111282843,0.0,0,0.0,652,64.40,71.99,22.99,88.30,16.30,11.50,89.26,57.06,16.56,9.97,1.38,3.07,0.92,1.38,3.22,6.60,6.44,15.49,8.74,2.45,6.13,3.37,17.64,3.68,2.30,1.84,0.77,0.77,6.44,5.06,1.38,0.00,0.31,0.00,11.35,0.15,0.00,0.00,1.53,14.57,3.68,2.76,2.30,1.84,1.23,4.75,1.23,0.46,0.31,0.15,3.22,0.00,2.61,0.00,0.61,12.88,3.68,2.15,6.90,1.69,0.31,2.30,13.04,2.45,10.43,2.45,5.98,1.53,0.92,0.61,0.61,0.92,3.37,0.31,0.31,0.00,0.15,0.15,0.00,0.00,11.20,5.52,3.99,0.15,0.00,0.00,0.61,0.31,0.00,0.61,0.00,0.00

t3_3eu8tm,"academia has always been like that. mind you, a lot of ""sjw's"" are college students, they are used to this style of talk about social issues and mimic it on tumblr. the way it is always been with social activism is that there is a sort of ""ivory tower"" side and a more ""hands on"" side to it. the latter organizes youth groups, teaches people about racism on their local school or community center, it organizes things like pride parades and history month celebrations. the former is deliberately all talk, its efforts go towards identifying and naming the phenomenons that surround the injustice and discussing solutions. this is not a new thing at all, take socialism for example, you had the academic elite discussing about concepts with big words and citations to lofty philosophers, there was the side that came in contact with people and riled them up or informed them. also take how sociology professors talk about microagressions and mental colonization, while black advocacy groups take those ideas and rather than preaching about them go into action to stop them. none of them does more than the other, they need each other to be effective and thorough. i think there are several problems with how ""sjw's"" are handling activism, but their academic or pseudo-academic approach is not it. refusing to educate others is regressive and a problem, yes of course, but the fact that advocacy includes complicated concepts and words is a nonissue.",ctigaob,218.5737181861872,1,1438048881,54,11,1252,0,47.887852459016415,244.0,387.0,10.0,5,0.1,0.0,0.3,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1,0.0,0.0,0.1,0.0,1.2000000000000002,0.012345679012345678,0.3237704918032787,0.0,0,0.0,245,63.94,68.78,38.09,19.66,24.50,21.63,84.49,51.43,12.65,4.90,0.41,0.00,0.82,0.00,3.67,7.76,6.12,13.47,7.76,4.90,8.57,1.22,12.65,4.90,2.86,0.82,0.00,4.08,1.22,0.41,0.82,0.00,0.00,0.00,11.02,0.00,0.41,0.00,0.00,13.47,2.86,2.04,1.63,2.04,2.04,5.31,0.82,0.41,0.00,0.41,0.41,0.41,0.00,0.00,0.00,9.39,2.45,2.04,2.86,1.63,1.22,3.27,11.43,0.00,12.24,2.04,6.53,3.67,5.31,0.82,0.00,0.00,0.41,0.00,0.82,0.00,0.41,0.41,0.00,0.00,13.88,4.08,5.31,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.41,3.27,0.82,0.00,0.00
t3_3eu8tm,">like other left-leaning movements there is no ""sjw movement."" it is just a pejorative label. there is no group that self-identifies as sjws. there is no ""sjw"" organization. no sjw leaders. no sjw conferences. what you view as a movement is just a bunch of independent people with similar conceptions of social justice, and they may have different views on politics, economics, etc. >a college education (or at the very least, the internet and plenty of time on one's hands) seems to be a standard cost of entry for dialogue with a typical sjw. dialogue that consists of terms and concepts such as: patriarchy, heteronormativity, trans-exclusionary radical feminist (terf), cisgendered, gender spectrum, gentrification, respectability politics, privilege, oppression, identity, assimilation, queer, otherkin, institutionalization, marginalization, etc....i could keep going. so...what, they should not use any terms to describe certain societal phenomenons? cis and trans are not hard concepts to learn, in fact they are being talked about all the time on the news thanks to people like caitlyn jenner. gender spectrum is not hard to figure out either. spectrum is a pretty easy word. combine that with gender, and it means exactly what it says on the tin! gentrification is not a ""sjw"" term, it is a term coined by sociologists to describe a very specific phenomenon. people who are affected by it know exactly what it is, even if they do not have a specific term to describe it. giving it a name just makes it easier to communicate. privilege is pretty easy to define. so is oppression. and identity. and assimilation. these four mean the same as their colloquial definition. queer is something new, but it is strongly associated with gay rights so its not hard to introduce people to that term. otherkin is not something people are actually pushing for, where are you getting that from? what movement and mainstream figures are pushing for otherkin rights? none, but mentioning this term is how i can tell your view is colored too heavily by what you see and hear about ""sjws"" on this site (i'm assuming from subreddits like /r/tumblrinaction and /r/adviceanimals). institutional is not hard either, it means exactly what it sounds like. marginalized is not an uncommon term either. **note:** even if you do not agree that these terms accurately describe power dynamics in society, that does not mean the terms are bad >these are all terms that i have just pulled directly from sjw tumblr pages/comments. tumblr is just a blogging site with *more users* than reddit. a bunch of users on a social media site is not indicative of a social movement, especially if they do not even identify as such. your view is skewed by what you see on reddit. they are a tiny, tiny, *tiny* fraction of users. they get attention because people like to go out and find stuff that offends them (ironically, just like the sjws that are criticized!) and post it for cheap karma. slap an outrageous quote on an image macro and you have got the attention of tens of thousands of users. >but there are still layers to each concept (such as privilege or oppression) that people may have a difficult time grasping if it was the first time they have been exposed to these ideas problem is, most people's first exposure to the idea is usually through pages dismissive of the concepts. i think that is a much bigger issue than the terms themselves. >how might someone who could only afford a high school education feel? tumblr's demographics skew pretty young, just like reddit. there is a lot of high schoolers on the site who do just fine. >or at least the time to sit down and learn these concepts these are not advanced-level sociological concepts. these are basic 101 terms, most of which, as i have described above, match pretty closely with their colloquial definitions. i think you are exaggerating how difficult these terms are. i'm not a sociologist nor have i taken any gender studies classes. nowhere in college have i learned about these terms. if you were able to read about it on a blog, how high do you really think the barrier of entry is? social media use is absolutely *huge* among youths today. >how is this use of privileged language encouraging those who are economically and educationally marginalized to participate? because it gives them a name to what they are experiencing. take for example, gentrification. a poor black family is forced out of their home due to rising rent costs because of yuppies moving in. what exactly is he supposed to call that? do you have a better term in mind? >i do not want to generalize, but from my own experience, a majority of sjws enjoy doing what they do because they like winning arguments. it is not about empowering and educating. in the face of ignorance, sjws tend to belittle and insult, rather than educate or allow for a balance dialogue. your view of social activists seems entirely limited to what you have seen on places like reddit. stop and realize that what you are viewing is intentionally cherry-picked to enrage its audience.",ctijckt,1511.893663847751,1,1438054057,54,11,6428,0,59.86044096647058,861.0,1350.0,61.0,24,0.0,0.0,0.09836065573770492,0.21311475409836064,0.0,0.01639344262295082,0.0,0.04918032786885246,0.01639344262295082,0.01639344262295082,0.01639344262295082,0.01639344262295082,0.0,0.0,0.44262295081967223,NaN,0.24390243902439024,0.0,0,0.0,872,57.09,54.56,27.61,49.23,14.78,21.33,83.83,52.75,13.07,5.16,1.38,0.00,1.72,0.11,1.95,7.91,5.50,13.19,9.86,5.05,5.85,2.87,16.28,5.96,3.67,2.75,0.57,2.52,3.78,2.52,1.26,0.00,0.69,0.00,8.60,0.11,0.00,0.00,0.23,15.02,3.21,2.18,1.26,3.67,1.83,4.93,2.75,1.38,0.34,0.80,0.57,0.23,0.00,0.34,0.00,6.08,1.03,0.92,3.21,0.92,0.57,1.38,13.19,0.46,9.29,1.49,5.16,2.52,2.41,1.03,0.34,0.80,0.11,0.00,1.15,0.00,0.92,0.23,0.00,0.00,18.69,6.42,5.05,0.23,0.00,0.92,0.23,0.57,0.92,0.57,1.15,2.64
t3_2yd5o8,"integration has a number of aspects, and i suspect the debate will become complicated if we do not analyze them and distinguish between different types of integration and the justifications for each. >...yet today their ancestors chastise mexicans and arabs for not learning english... yes. nations need a certain amount of *coordination* to flourish. for example, an australian or brit who immigrates to the us has to give up his proud cultural tradition of driving on the left. this is not a judgment about which side of the street is a *better* side to drive on. it is purely a relative judgment. if you drive on the left side of the highway in sydney, nothing unusual happens; if you drive on the left side of the highway in nyc, you are doing to have a head on collision. it is beneficial to a nation to have everyone driving on the same side of the road. that's what *coordination* is. that applies to language as well. one of the strengths of america, historically, is that we have had one national language that everyone can communicate in. we have always had large immigrant communities, but never had a problem with large segments of the population being excluded from american society, or rivalry between different linguistic blocs, or the public sphere fragmenting into two different discussions. getting everyone to speak english is just good coordination. there are other kinds of coordination, too - different types of behavior and norms that are fine if everyone follows them, but bad if they undermine what everyone else is trying to accomplish with their behavior. >i think the idea that immigrants need to integrate into the culture of their host nations stems from racism, or at the very least a feeling that their culture is somehow superior. yes! it does stem from a feeling of cultural superiority. if you are moving from country a to country b, then i think we need to assume one of the following two things is going on: 1. everything was fine when you were living in a, but you love the culture b so much that you decide to put up with the difficulty of the move. 2. life in a was getting to be extremely shitty in one way or another, so despite your indifference, contempt, or outright loathing for the culture of b, you decided to move to b. people in situation -1- obviously do not need to be encouraged to integrate. people in situation -2-, on the other hand, need to ask hard questions: why is it that country a, your native country whose culture is familiar and comfortable, is so shitty that you left behind everything to start over somewhere else, whereas country b, the new country whose culture seems unfamiliar and ugly, is so amazing that you chose to live here rather than your native land? in some cases the shittiness of country a relates to economics. in other cases it relates to war. in still other cases it relates to tyranny. whatever the cause is, an immigrant who is moving from country a to country b needs to seriously consider the possibility that part of the reason that country b *isn't shitty* is that b-ish culture builds successful societies. and if you are, essentially, leaving a team where the team's customs and attitudes made life miserable for lots of people on the team, and joining a new team where the customs and attitudes have made life great, it would be pretty hypocritical not to try to pick up the customs and attitudes of your new team. why would it be okay for you to benefit from being on a great team without participating in the teamwork? now, you can reply to this in lots of ways. you can say that maybe some immigrants were forced to come here by their parents, so they are not committed to either -1- or -2-. maybe the immigrants believe *their* country is actually more successful, but they just like the scenery here. maybe they know their native country is shitty, but they do not take seriously any possibility that it is anything more than bad luck. or maybe they know their native country is shitty, and admit the culture plays a role, but do not see why they should not simply reap the benefits of their hosts' culture while despising it. you can make any of these five excuses, or maybe a lot more, but you can't say it is *unreasonable* for the hosts to think they *should* integrate, because it is not unreasonable to assume that immigrants have some serious reason for preferring the host country, that overall a large net influx of immigrants suggests the host country is systematically more successful in a way that the immigrants themselves appreciate, and that cultural differences do explain some differences between some countries. and if those are reasonable things to think, then even though you do not have to *agree* with them, you certainly have to admit that there is nothing *wrong* with expecting immigrants to integrate, and that that expectation can be motivated by something other than racism. > cultures change and there is nothing wrong with that. even if it a native actually believed that all of the cultural differences between him and the potential immigrants were *trivial and purely cosmetic*, there is nothing wrong with having preferences between cultures. let us say part of the culture of my country is that we have beethoven concerts in the city park every summer, but the potential immigrants are coming from a country where there is a tradition of public shostakovich concerts. there is nothing wrong with me considering, when i am voting on whether to allow more immigration or not, that if there is a great deal of immigration beethoven will be replaced by shostakovich, *and i will not enjoy that*. in other words: if there is ""nothing wrong"" with culture changing, then there is no important moral issue at stake. and if there is no important moral issue at stake, then it is fine to support one change over another simply because you prefer it. > i understand that swedes have a lot of pride in their country and cultural history, but expecting muslim immigrants to love it as much as they do is absurd. absurd? why? i see three possibilities. the first is that you see being a ""swede"" as a genetic thing, and think that only people who are genetic descendants of other, earlier swedes can be swedes or have pride in sweden. the second is that you see being a ""swede"" as a political thing, but you think that you can't be a swedish citizen unless you were born in sweden and were raised by swedes, so you appreciate it properly. the third is that you think muslims *could* become swedes, but they do not want to. as an american, your views strike me as charmingly european, because if i restated these views about my own country: ""expecting muslim immigrants to love america and its cultural history as much as americans do is absurd"", well, it is grotesque. most muslim immigrants are already americans. when they have children, they are americans. many of them probably are applying right now to bring relatives over so they can be americans to. given that they are *already* americans, there is nothing absurd about expecting them to love america as much as americans do.",cp8vpwz,1213.424427090537,1,1425883312,66,13,35269,0,55.27376213592234,1236.0,1887.0,56.0,23,0.0,0.0,0.26785714285714285,0.5892857142857143,0.0,0.0,0.017857142857142856,0.0,0.0,0.017857142857142856,0.0,0.017857142857142856,0.10714285714285714,0.0,1.017857142857143,NaN,0.17637540453074432,0.0,0,0.0,1243,56.58,67.38,42.02,52.96,22.60,23.41,87.69,57.84,13.92,6.60,0.97,0.56,2.49,0.16,2.41,7.24,6.84,14.24,10.14,5.47,7.48,2.25,15.53,4.99,2.65,1.61,1.45,2.65,5.39,3.38,1.93,0.08,0.80,0.08,11.91,0.16,0.00,0.00,0.16,17.86,3.62,1.77,2.90,4.83,2.01,6.76,1.29,0.48,0.48,0.32,1.37,0.64,0.40,0.00,0.00,6.28,2.09,1.69,1.53,1.13,0.72,1.85,12.31,1.29,11.50,1.85,7.32,2.25,1.37,0.80,0.00,0.08,0.48,0.08,1.61,0.48,0.64,0.32,0.16,0.00,14.64,4.42,5.07,0.32,0.08,0.32,0.08,0.80,0.64,0.48,0.00,2.41

t3_2z1yoq,"well first of all in the modern world inflation *isn't* used as fiscal policy. *inflation targeting* is monetary policy. second, the creation of new money in and of itself is not inflation. inflation is a rise in the general price level. if the monetary base expands but prices stay constant, than inflation has not occured. third, the new money does not usually go to the government, unless the central bank is buying government debt. most new money is created by private banks in the form of credit. the central bank (i.e., the fed) can incent this money creation through its influence over interest rates, or it can purchase financial assets and create money directly. fourth, over the long-run, incomes increase to match inflation *cet par*, so as long as inflation is low (~3% or less) and stable, it is not a problem at all. inflation is intentional in most if not all developed nations, usually targeted^1 at 2% for at least three reasons: 1. so in the advent of an economic emergency, the central bank can target a real interest rate below zero (real interest rate^2 = nominal interest rate^2a - expected inflation) so to prompt investment and stimulate the economy. 2. to avoid deflation. if we have deflation, the real value of debt increases over time (your $400,000 mortgage may, in real terms, become a $400,400 mortgage a year later unexpectedly, and this is bad), prompting a reduction in spending which will reduce the demand for money which will exacerbate the deflations and so on until the economy is in shambles. 3. to allow for a more robust labour market. wages are downwardly rigid (employers have a hard time reducing the wages of existing employees as those employees do not like their wages being cut), so the price of labour tends to be higher than is efficient during a downturn. workers do not react nearly so poorly to real reductions in wages as they do nominal ones (a 2% nominal wage increase and 4% inflation is the same as a 2% wage cut and no inflation, but workers only react poorly to the latter), so inflation can help employers lower wages when they need to without their workers getting angry. __________________________________________________ ^(1. the central bank does this by creating more money through various mechanisms. the value of money is subject to its supply and demand just like anything else.) ^(2. the interest rate when inflation is accounted for.) ^(2a. the interest rate when inflation is not accounted for. if the interest rate on a bank account for example is 2% and the rate of inflation is 4%, the real interest rate is actually -2%.)",cpezn48,207.06362545607436,1,1426371974,131,19,2735,0,58.80964578454336,427.0,669.0,28.0,10,0.0,0.0,0.07142857142857142,0.03571428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07142857142857142,0.03571428571428571,0.0,0.0,0.07142857142857142,0.0,0.2857142857142857,0.1304685026907249,0.2505854800936768,0.0,0,0.0,447,89.25,31.14,24.08,55.28,17.19,23.49,78.75,45.19,4.03,1.34,0.00,0.22,0.22,0.00,0.89,2.68,9.40,13.87,8.28,3.80,8.05,2.24,10.07,6.04,4.47,1.12,5.59,2.24,6.49,4.03,2.46,0.45,0.22,0.45,1.79,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,11.19,0.45,2.91,1.57,2.91,0.89,4.92,0.45,0.00,0.00,0.22,0.22,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.22,8.28,0.45,2.24,5.59,0.22,0.67,0.67,8.50,0.89,12.98,1.57,8.05,3.80,7.83,0.00,0.45,9.84,0.00,0.00,0.22,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.22,0.00,33.11,6.26,5.15,0.22,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.67,0.00,0.22,4.03,16.55
t3_2z1yoq,"there is far more to inflation than you seem to understand. frankly, i think this is the fault of the ron paul, goldbug type strain of thought, that has overly emphasized a small part of the economic doctrine. i think you need to read a basic economic text book on this, because i agree with another poster here, this is not the right forum for the discussion but you say, ""it's just a regressive tax"". this implies that it is nothing else. but that is absolutely wrong. here is an example. if cash experiences inflation at 3%, yes, this means that someone who holds their money in a bank account that is not receiving interest will lose 3% of the value of their money over the year. but because of this, they will be encouraged not to keep the money in the bank. and people who do not have their money in the bank, say, who have their wealth in the form of property ownership, will experience a benefit from the currency inflation. they will get a deflationary effect from everyone trying to convert their wealth into different forms. and that creates wealth for those people. when inflation is, say, 10% or more... the demand for other forms of wealth than cash will be high. and that does not create a tax on those with other forms of wealth. so maybe you can consider inflation a partial ""tax"" on cash, but it is not necessarily a tax on wealth. in fact, it can spur wealth creation for a large portion of society. that said, yeah, you need to read more on it. because there is more to it than you seem to understand. edit: i want to make clear, i am trying to change your view on the fact that you said it was ""just"" a regressive tax. i am not trying to change your view that is can be a regressive tax.",cpf0qg3,118.16233606528459,1,1426374251,131,19,5012,0,77.706875,320.0,427.0,20.0,9,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15,0.0,0.0,0.7500000000000001,NaN,0.209375,0.0,0,0.0,323,68.04,59.79,27.09,85.38,16.15,14.86,89.78,58.20,17.03,6.81,1.86,0.00,2.79,0.00,2.17,10.22,8.36,14.24,9.60,3.10,4.33,2.48,17.34,4.64,2.48,1.24,0.93,1.86,5.88,4.64,1.24,0.31,0.00,0.31,10.22,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,17.34,3.10,3.41,1.24,2.79,2.48,6.19,3.10,0.93,1.55,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,8.67,0.31,2.17,4.95,0.62,0.93,0.93,13.31,1.55,7.43,0.93,5.88,0.93,4.64,0.31,0.00,8.36,0.00,0.00,1.24,0.00,0.00,1.24,0.00,0.00,16.10,6.81,5.88,0.31,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.86,0.31,0.00,0.93

[source] (that contrasts the ~3.9 million babies born each year. [source](in other words, the majority children in the us who can be adopted *are* adopted, and even if all of them were, it would not cover even 2.5% of the births that happen. it is also important to note that even with all those births, the us does not meet its replacement rate. that means that our population would be declining if not for massive amount of immigrants we take in. now, why is this important? because our economic and especially our social systems depend on new productive workers to enter the workforce as old ones retire. without them, the economy would collapse, social programs would go bankrupt, and we would basically experience a long depression until our population rates stabilized or increased. now why is it selfish? well, while society bares *some* of the cost of creating these new workers through free public education, the vast majority of the money and time used to produce them comes from the parents of the child. in other words, the parents are sacrificing their own resources to produce something that all of society needs. this is the opposite of selfish. alternatively, a person who does not have children and retires is instead reaping the advantages of having those new workers work in factories and pay taxes for things like social security benefits and firefighters without having to contribute to making new workers themselves. from a societal perspective, that is much more selfish.",cs97753,377.6670074283304,1,1434516859,28,10,6394,0,54.672111383108955,344.0,544.0,19.0,63,0.05263157894736842,0.0,0.15789473684210525,0.21052631578947367,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21052631578947367,0.05263157894736842,0.05263157894736842,0.8421052631578947,0.02670940170940171,0.26744186046511625,0.0,0,0.0,354,57.66,83.16,15.75,41.07,20.82,24.58,87.85,55.08,14.12,6.78,0.28,3.95,0.56,0.00,1.98,7.34,7.06,12.71,9.60,5.08,6.21,2.54,14.12,3.95,1.69,1.69,3.67,3.67,4.24,2.54,1.69,0.00,0.00,0.56,12.99,0.85,0.00,0.00,0.00,14.41,1.13,3.95,2.54,2.54,1.41,5.08,0.28,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.85,0.00,0.28,0.00,0.56,12.99,5.93,2.54,4.80,0.85,0.85,1.41,10.45,0.00,11.02,1.41,4.52,5.08,7.06,0.00,0.00,2.54,0.28,0.00,0.56,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.28,0.28,15.54,4.24,6.78,0.00,0.00,0.56,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.13,2.82
t3_398e6j,"i have been reading trp for over a year now, and i feel like i understand them somewhat. as a group they do not condone rape or beating women like some members of reddit would have you believe. in this sense, they do not deserve the hate that they receive over reddit. however, i would still classify them as a hate group. it is part of their philosophy to de-pedestal women. the men in the subreddit came from a position where they viewed women as angelic creatures, and so trp tries to shock them out of this mindset by highlighting the bad side of women. now this is not hateful by itself, but a portion of the members start to believe in this exaggerated caricature of women. the believe that the picture trp presents is an accurate, objective description of women. if you believe that women are irrational, deceptive, exploitive, entitled, and unaccountable by nature, it becomes much easier to treat them badly, or even take away their rights. you see this theme repeated by mods and endorsed contributors on the site, not just members in the anger phase. i am not sure if i should link the subreddit here, but here is a quote from one of the biggest contributors on trp. > indeed, a ""good woman"" in a third world country finds the powerlessness that made her good is gone when she reaches the west. the state as well as the female hivemind in the west will ""empower"" her to be a cunt, to asset strip you, screw you for child support and be a whore. as such, her carnal nature will take over and she will prove to you that given the chance, given enough power to exploit, almost all women are the same, and the woman that you think ""is different"" probably isn't. any modicum of decency or logic in most women is vastly obliterated by emotional and financial incentive that corruption offers her. keep the third world women in the third world, lest you spoil them. here is another quote that i read recently, not from an endorsed contributor, but still upvoted in it is thread. > women, in general, are emotional children with limited agency and much less ability to assume responsibility as men. they should be given less rights but less responsibility to compensate - the same way we treat actual children. and another upvoted quote.. >because once people understand that women are backward retards, who crave abuse and despise goodness, they will question why we do silly things like let them vote or run for president. i can pm you the actual threads if you would like to read it in context for yourself. so my problem with trp is not that they use harsh language or let men vent. they use their extreme negative caricature of women to justify treating them badly or take away their rights.",cs1f989,388.00226872576314,1,1433937205,191,16,13065,0,62.92365295031058,483.0,705.0,24.0,0,0.041666666666666664,0.0,0.4166666666666667,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7083333333333334,0.05951109844971738,0.2650103519668737,0.0,0,0.0,484,63.41,78.99,24.93,5.72,20.17,19.83,86.16,54.55,14.67,9.71,1.86,0.41,2.27,1.24,3.93,4.96,7.23,13.43,7.85,4.55,7.44,1.86,14.46,4.96,4.13,0.83,1.03,3.10,6.82,2.48,4.34,0.21,1.86,0.00,14.67,0.00,0.00,4.55,0.62,12.81,3.51,1.24,1.86,3.72,1.03,4.75,1.03,0.41,0.00,0.41,0.62,0.00,0.00,0.62,0.00,6.40,1.45,1.03,2.48,1.24,0.41,1.65,10.33,0.83,9.92,1.03,7.02,2.27,1.45,0.41,0.00,0.41,0.21,0.00,1.65,0.83,0.41,0.21,0.21,0.00,13.43,5.17,5.79,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.41,1.24,0.21,0.00,0.62
t3_3fvhvp,"i have seen this video (love cgp), and i feel yes and no. point a) *within the next few decades, ai will replace a sizable portion of our jobs.* yes. this much is clear, and it is hilarious because, as genetic modification makes our food more vulnerable to disease, by creating specialization in our economy we have set ourselves up for this. no arguments there. point b) *within a few centuries, they will replace almost all of them.* here i disagree. we are going to go through a real rough patch, perhaps even causing a weird great depression style collapse, but 200 years ago, 90 percent of americans were agriculturalists. today, that number is two percent. we evolved, and if you remember the dust bowl struggles when industrial farming came about, you will remember that was a struggle too. we'll remodel our society, as we have for the past forever, to fit needs that, in theory, robots cannot fill, including: 1. **space exploration and colonization.** yes, robots have been and are doing an amazing job exploring space for us already, but the value of having a human on another planet, or out in space exploring, is uncountable. ai would help us be able to focus more on the expansion of our species into space. 2. **entertainment** my biggest disagreement with the cgp video is how he frames the idea of entertainers being replaced by ai. sure, they can write beautiful music, but how much is recorded music going for right now, anyway? and people enjoy watching people perform. there is nothing particularly beautiful about an arabesque, but what is beautiful is watching a person do it. same with acting, singing, sports, etc. 3. **engineering**: this one seems pretty simple. it will be a long time (in theory) before we can automate robots that can out engineer us. 4. **cyber protection** this is the biggest one. if all of our medical information is on a universal collection of robot interfaces, we will need basically an endless army of humans to help defend this from hackers. the more ai we have, the more we need to protect it. people who would be able to take control of that ai would control the world. there's a lot more, and it is going to be a hard road, but at the end of it, our society will evolve so that our jobs will be more fulfilling and human-necessary. just as you do not weep for the iceman, the lamplighter, and the switchboard operator, know that no one will be weeping for the barista, the paralegal, or taxi driver.",ctsbzuq,90.92294593833552,1,1438789076,63,9,3324,0,65.05900623052959,428.0,644.0,30.0,2,0.0,0.0,0.16666666666666666,0.23333333333333334,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.0,0.5333333333333333,0.021470866298452504,0.2827102803738318,0.0,0,0.0,435,60.48,85.49,19.60,37.99,16.11,20.46,85.98,52.64,12.41,7.36,0.92,4.83,0.69,0.23,0.69,5.06,7.36,11.95,11.49,4.60,6.21,1.38,16.32,6.44,2.99,1.15,2.30,3.68,5.75,3.22,2.53,0.69,0.23,0.69,9.89,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.23,11.26,2.30,1.84,1.84,2.53,1.84,2.53,3.45,2.07,0.69,0.69,1.15,0.00,0.69,0.00,0.23,9.66,5.52,0.92,2.53,0.69,0.69,2.30,10.11,2.76,12.18,2.53,6.44,3.22,1.84,1.84,0.23,0.23,0.00,0.00,1.15,0.00,0.23,0.69,0.00,0.23,22.76,6.67,8.74,0.46,0.00,0.23,0.00,0.23,0.00,0.46,1.38,4.60

t3_3a6gq1,"i do not think the benefits of sports are reserved for ""troubled youths"" and i do not think those benefits are reserved only for sports. any sort of competition can breed those qualities and build character. here is a short list of what i think sports did for me and countless other kids while growing up: **relating to others:** when you get on a sports team, you see how different all the kids are. some are awesome, some suck. some have great attitudes, some are shitty. some are quiet, some are loud. just encountering all these different types of people gives you the opportunity to appreciate what makes people likable and what makes them distasteful. hopefully, you get to experience how different people can do things in different ways and still be equally successful. that is something that so many kids who never do extracurricular activities ever encounter. **refinement:** when you start at a sport, you suck. but you do not think you are that bad, you probably weren't even the worst on your team. but then as you go along, you start to realize how truly terrible you are. even the good kids on your team are just slightly less trashy than you. if you really get excited and you start practicing and working out, you will really get to see some development. i have encountered countless adults who have no idea how to apply themselves to something they want. i attribute much of this to not realizing that you can change who you are simply by applying single-minded focus to a task you want to be good at. **sacrifice:** you yourself mentioned how you gave up other things so that you could pursue your sport of choice only to find out later in life that it didn't give you much. i disagree, it taught you sacrifice. everything in life has an opportunity cost and by doing one thing you are specifically not doing something else. sitting around watching netflix? you could be out hiking. working at mcdonalds making minimum wage? you could be making twice as much working somewhere else. if for any reason you do not like any aspect of your life (or game) just put aside your cushy environment and go work it out for a bit. when you come back to the rest of the world, you will have this new skill that you can use to win that next interview (or game) and move on in life (or to the championship). everyone is spending their time out there on the field, but the winners are the ones who might be spending a little bit more and doing some of the less fun things to see better results in the end. **dealing with bullshit:** ever get a bad call by a ref that determined a game? how about get harassed by a cop when you didn't do anything? life is full of bullshit, and sports teaches you how to deal with an unfair world from an early age. **fight for what you want:** any competitive game from soccer to poker involves you trying to win at a game where other people are actively trying to make you lose. in life, opportunities are often taken by those who are willing to fight for them. for the rest of your life, people around you will put immense amounts of effort in undermining your legitimacy, taking credit for things you did yourself, and just generally making you lose. sports have the opportunity to teach kids how to check that shit like they did in hockey. certain hits are acceptable, certain ones aren't. you can only find out by knowing the game and how its played. **knowing the rules and knowing how the game is played:** basically said above. what is written in the rule book does not always reflect what is and is not true. sports are a very apparent example of this. and perhaps most important, **dealing with loss:** sometimes you tried your hardest. you put your whole soul into something. and at the end of the day, you just plain weren't good enough. is that an excuse to give up? unfortunately, i think a lot of team sports insulate the best players from this feeling because they spend so much time practicing that they never actually have to face a real and true loss. losses are the best opportunity for learning. you have time to reflect every painful detail as it happened. your mind just keeps going through the situation over and over. sports should teach you to use that opportunity to think of what you could have done differently and rather than getting upset about it, remembering it for later. because some day later in life, a similar situation will come up again, and you will be ready for it next time. most important of all, if you do not get up and get back out there, you will not ever get the change to move past the loss emotionally. this is a life skill that i think individual sports tend to teach better, but all sports offer the opportunity. in the end, i do not think sports is necessary at all. but ""troubled kids"" often do not have any other outlets to apply themselves at. they do not understand what math and english will do for them for the rest of their lives (and do not have a parent willing to explain how important it is), but football is fun. it is an easy way to sneak in some life lessons while letting the kids run around. sports are not always the answer, but they are a lot better than a class room for life lessons imo.",cs9t89j,1352.6746886874269,1,1434568671,25,8,6289,0,71.09188953543834,953.0,1331.0,55.0,2,0.01818181818181818,0.0,0.18181818181818182,0.18181818181818182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01818181818181818,0.01818181818181818,0.0,0.01818181818181818,0.01818181818181818,0.14545454545454545,0.0,0.6000000000000001,0.04404093848538294,0.18992654774396642,0.0,0,0.0,953,46.81,83.55,44.35,69.29,17.33,15.32,93.18,57.08,15.53,8.81,1.05,0.00,6.40,0.00,1.36,6.61,5.77,13.75,9.97,6.61,6.72,2.31,19.10,5.46,2.94,3.04,0.31,4.09,7.56,4.83,2.52,0.10,0.73,0.63,12.70,0.10,0.00,0.00,0.00,18.36,3.36,2.73,1.36,4.41,2.41,5.35,1.15,0.42,0.31,0.31,1.68,0.31,1.36,0.00,0.00,10.07,1.26,4.41,2.94,3.88,1.15,1.99,13.22,1.15,11.75,1.57,5.88,4.51,3.67,3.88,0.10,0.63,0.31,0.00,0.73,0.63,0.00,0.10,0.00,0.00,14.59,5.25,3.15,0.84,0.00,0.52,0.00,0.10,0.42,0.52,0.84,2.94

t3_3dltd8,"buzzfeed is actually starting to move away from clickbaity headlines. partially due to the criticism they have received, but also because facebook and google are starting to give less visibility to them, which puts a huge dent in social sharing metrics. you have to realize that ""clickbait"" headlines are really just the 21st century equivalent of the tired, pun-laced and cliched newspaper headlines that have only recently started to fall out of fashion among editors. i wouldn't say that news organizations are copying buzzfeed, but buzzfeed is definitely forcing them to compete more. that is good at the end of the day. wapo, new york times etc. have stepped up their mobile game and they are doing more to reach millennials. that's not a direct result of buzzfeed, but buzzfeed is still forcing them to fight for relevancy. i'll admit i am not really a huge fan of buzzfeed. but i think your criticisms are more reflective of what they did in the past rather than what they are doing now. on their front page right now there are no ""you will not believe what happened next"" headlines. there is a good mix of hard national news in addition to their standard traffic driving fluff articles. it is much better than it used to be so i will give them credit for that. speaking of fluff?what's wrong with it? it is no different from how newspapers traditionally worked in the past. the sports and entertainment sections of local newspapers are probably the most read, and it takes the lowest effort for the newspaper to produce. but they produce it because it effectively subsidizes the actual hard-hitting news and investigative pieces that take months to get to print, even though those pieces tend to get less views. it is just a way for news organizations to be able to finance what is core to their purpose. lastly, buzzfeed's business model has proved to be sustainable for the time being. many other news organizations still have not figured that out yet for themselves. so buzzfeed is an important model that other organizations can replicate and refine upon. at the end of the day i will take some garbage with my news over no news at all. which brings me to my last point: do you pay for any subscriptions to news websites? if you don't, then at the end of the day it is your fault that so many news organizations have to copy what buzzfeed is doing.",ct6p6z7,3356.9581105476536,1,1437153863,35,9,2151,0,63.96858974358976,416.0,616.0,24.0,3,0.08333333333333333,0.0,0.375,0.16666666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.125,0.0,0.7916666666666666,0.05522665740057043,0.2668269230769231,0.0,0,0.0,419,58.03,49.05,59.44,34.02,17.46,20.53,83.29,55.61,14.08,6.92,2.15,0.00,1.43,0.00,3.34,7.16,5.49,14.80,10.98,5.49,5.25,2.15,16.71,4.77,3.10,2.15,0.00,3.34,3.34,1.91,1.43,0.00,0.72,0.24,7.40,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,10.26,1.91,2.15,0.72,1.19,0.72,4.77,1.67,0.24,0.95,0.48,0.24,0.00,0.24,0.00,0.00,6.21,1.19,1.43,1.67,1.91,0.48,1.67,12.89,1.19,14.32,1.67,6.21,6.68,4.06,0.95,0.00,1.19,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,11.22,5.25,2.39,0.24,0.00,0.48,0.00,0.48,0.95,1.43,0.00,0.00

t3_2w5vr9,"even if we ignore all the misogyny and other complaints, the red pill is an awful culture that preys upon downtrodden men who have been abused and rejected by women. say you are a man whose wife cheated on him. you just got out of a brutal divorce where you lost access to your kids, and a huge chunk of the money you have earned. you are at rock bottom. imagine two guys who could influence you at this point. one guy is good guy greg. he helps you pick yourself up, make friends, continue to be a good father, helps you get your job and finances back into order, helps you recover emotionally when it comes to women. after a long recovery time, ideally you would get to the stage where you are happy with your job, feel supported and loved by your kids, tolerate your ex-wife, and able to enter a rewarding and healthy relationship with another woman. now instead of that, imagine scumbag steve shows up. he tells you that the reason you lost your wife is because you weren't manly enough. your wife is a skank, but all women are like that. if you were a real man, you would be able to take control. you need to improve yourself. you need to learn to use women for your ends, but avoid getting too attached. screw getting into a real and rewarding relationship, forget love. all that matters is power, and sexual strategy is the way to get it. after a few years, you will be in the same place. you might be better at tricking women into sex, but you will not be happy. you will not be able to move on. i used the emotionally abused divorced guy in my example, but the red pill also preys upon guys who are rejected by women. the subreddit is like a cult. it is strategies seem appealing, but they do not work. they let people vent and feel like they are a part of a community, but they lead to people rejecting the outside world in favor of the red pill group. it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. if you treat women like crap, then they will treat you poorly, and it will confirm your original bias. sadly though, its hard to blame them. every person in that subreddit has been emotionally abused or rejected by some woman, otherwise they never would have joined. they promote those ideas because that is the only way they can understand what is happening to them. in this sense, they are like abused pit bulls who are lashing out. so perhaps reddit's attitude is wrong indeed. instead of vilifying them, maybe we should try to help them.",conwndt,980.3089046558268,1,1424154249,184,17,4162,0,73.76515211406792,457.0,638.0,31.0,51,0.03225806451612903,0.03225806451612903,0.25806451612903225,0.0967741935483871,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03225806451612903,0.03225806451612903,0.0,0.4838709677419354,0.01875,0.2647702407002188,0.0,0,0.0,458,48.68,99.00,12.82,19.27,14.77,14.63,93.23,55.90,17.25,12.01,0.44,0.44,7.64,0.66,2.84,5.24,6.11,12.01,10.48,3.93,6.33,1.09,17.47,3.49,2.18,1.97,0.44,1.97,9.17,4.37,4.80,0.22,1.97,1.53,23.14,1.53,1.31,2.84,2.84,12.66,2.40,2.18,2.40,2.18,1.31,4.15,1.97,0.87,0.22,0.66,1.97,0.22,0.66,0.66,0.66,14.19,3.93,4.59,3.49,3.49,0.44,2.40,13.10,1.53,10.26,0.87,6.77,2.62,1.75,0.44,0.00,0.87,0.22,0.00,1.31,0.66,0.22,0.22,0.00,0.00,13.32,6.77,5.90,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.22,0.00,0.44,0.00,0.00

if one were to get incredibly ill, and was unable to pay for the entirety of their care, would you consider them an unwarranted cost on society? ought they simply be left to die for the greater good? what if it were your young son? you have to understand that when discussing matters of life and death, money is not the correct language. the value of human life cannot be measured in dollars. it is measured in emotion, love, connections, influence... have you never been impacted by another human being? how can you measure the impact and importance of a kind, positive person. that individual will walk through their life leaving positive impressions and effects all around them - like a wake behind a boat, rippling out and out, influencing the next person and the next, who then turns around and continues that outward spread. have you never been effected by a warm smile, or a bit of small-talk? clearly, i disagree with the entire premise of your argument. i think it shows a profound lack of empathy, or better yet, any actual understanding of life and humanity. however, let us go on and debate this on your own terms. you say that the cost of caring for these sick kids is not justified by the potential of their being great successes, simply because the odds of that happening are too slim. >>"" i understand that an argument can be made to the effect that these children grow up to be geniuses, and great innovators. however this argument falls apart when we look at expected returns from spending. it is extremely unlikely that our sick child is the next einstein or trump."" you are right that the odds are slim, however you are wrong to say that therefore ""the argument falls apart when we look at expected returns."" let us use your einstein example. how does one quantify the monetary worth of a great scientist? let us imagine that we had never had the contributions of watson & crick. without the discovery and understanding of dna, where would modern medicine stand today? is caring for 100 thousand ""average"" sick kids worth the preservation of 1 watson & crick equivalent? i would certainly say so. let's look at a businessman like steve jobs. how much wealth did he create in his lifetime? how many billions and billions of dollars were generated in the development, production, distribution and sales of his products? you say, ""he's 1 in a million,"" right? well, let us imagine he has generated 10 billion dollars of wealth in his lifetime (rather conservative). him being 1 in a million means that we could spend 1,000 dollars on each and every one of the other 999,000 individuals and we would only just then reach his worth. moreover, that's assuming that the other 999,000 people contributed *absolutely zero value over their entire lives*. the other problem with your argument is that you seem to believe that great people exist in vacuums. perhaps the sick kid you save is our next great scientist's little cousin. perhaps his or her little cousin's perseverance, strength, or tragic death, has motivated and inspired our future scientist to do great things. perhaps this sick child lives long enough to make friends in school. perhaps he or she loves science fiction books and movies, and that interest rubs off on one of his/her friends who otherwise wouldn't have picked up this interest at such a young age. perhaps that nascent interest in the wonders of science and its possibilities was *invaluable* in the formation of our next great scientist. the bottom line is, trying to place a dollar amount on the value of a human life is hopeless. we exist in infinitely complex social environments, and even ""average"" people can be instrumental in the generation of massive, valuable changes in the world. all that aside, we preserve the lives of ill children (or of any age), because someone loves them. they do not want to lose them. there is no dollar amount one can place on that.",ctqas8t,865.8210078478111,1,1438662521,51,16,4075,0,61.72862340896512,834.0,1270.0,52.0,2,0.038461538461538464,0.038461538461538464,0.17307692307692307,0.19230769230769232,0.0,0.0,0.019230769230769232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.019230769230769232,0.0,0.17307692307692307,0.0,0.6538461538461537,0.035992003639062464,0.22541966426858512,0.0,0,0.0,847,49.88,93.00,24.01,85.59,16.29,23.14,90.44,53.48,15.23,9.56,0.59,2.24,2.36,1.65,2.72,5.67,6.26,11.81,9.45,5.31,7.32,1.30,15.11,5.55,0.83,1.53,2.83,2.48,8.03,5.67,2.24,0.00,0.83,0.35,15.94,0.71,0.35,0.35,1.42,16.06,3.54,3.66,2.13,4.01,2.13,3.90,1.53,0.59,0.47,0.47,2.83,0.12,2.13,0.00,0.00,10.15,4.13,1.30,2.83,1.77,0.47,1.77,11.92,0.94,12.51,1.65,6.97,3.90,2.01,0.59,0.47,2.36,0.00,0.35,0.24,0.00,0.00,0.12,0.12,0.00,18.18,4.84,6.49,0.00,0.00,1.53,0.00,0.24,2.60,0.71,0.47,1.30

t3_37b2pr,"i think that you underestimate the influence that romance languages had on english as it was developing, and i would argue that it is an equally important component . for english to go back to its ""roots"" where only anglo-saxon counts, you would need to completely restructure the language to something incomprehensible to modern english speakers. you would essentially be creating an entirely new language. the concept of language regulators is a relatively new concept that developed during colonial times. in fact, the oldest thing that resembles a current language regulator is the oxford english dictionary. this was created long after old norman had entered the picture. it should also be noted that a lot of the major differences in american and british spelling and pronunciation came about when organizations tried to codify the language, as you are suggesting we do. as a bookkeeper, i think it is wrong to imply that english does not create words using simple concepts. i also think it is wrong to suggest that creating words out of simple concepts would streamline english or make it easier to understand. a bookkeeper could also be a librarian or a bookstore owner using your version of english. on /r/anglish they give kangaroo as an example, explaining that ""leapdeer"" could be an alternative, but what would call gazelle, or impala, or antelopes? they are all types of deer that have a penchant for leaping. anglish may have worked 1300 years ago when the world was a much simpler place, but english has evolved with the times to describe the ever-expanding universe. from what i can tell, most contemporary germanic languages use variations of the greek words to describe sciences. so english is not alone in that change. i also find the concept of calling geology ""earthlore"" upsetting. as lore in contemporary english has the connotation of being fictitious, and the only people who view geology as fictitious are creationists! on a personal level, the reasons you give for wanting a language regulator are the reasons i love english. english is not pretentious, it is not caught up in maintaining itself or its purity. i like that we argue over the oxford comma and the pronunciation of gif (hard g). that we add selfie to the dictionary and that we do not call tacos ""stuffed flat bread"". if a language already has a word for something we just take it as is (minus some bastardization for pronunciation purposes) and add it to the dictionary. if it does not have a word for it and move on. i like that we do not have an official body that is fretting over whether outside influences are destroying our language and culture. at its core english is a language of inclusion, adaptation, and growth. what you see as a detriment to the language, i see as a benefit. since english is such a vast and chaotic language non-native speakers can get away with a lot more and we will still understand them.",crlhcyw,730.4751817049081,1,1432663017,120,7,28751,0,54.75846720214193,498.0,785.0,27.0,1,0.14814814814814814,0.0,0.1111111111111111,0.14814814814814814,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.0,0.0,0.48148148148148145,0.08321123321123322,0.2710843373493976,0.0,0,0.0,503,66.05,69.04,18.88,36.24,18.63,26.84,82.50,54.67,13.32,5.57,1.99,1.59,1.39,0.00,0.60,7.75,9.15,12.52,10.14,3.98,7.55,1.39,16.70,5.96,3.38,1.59,0.20,2.19,3.98,2.19,1.59,0.20,0.80,0.20,9.54,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,13.52,1.99,3.38,2.39,2.78,1.19,3.98,1.79,1.19,0.40,0.20,0.80,0.20,0.00,0.00,0.40,7.16,1.99,1.39,2.39,0.99,0.40,2.58,11.93,0.40,10.14,1.39,5.17,3.78,2.58,0.80,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.60,0.20,0.40,0.00,0.00,0.00,12.13,4.97,3.38,0.00,0.00,0.20,0.20,0.60,1.59,0.00,0.80,0.40
t3_2yf7qq,"i feel like you are not engaging with the force of the ""let the parents do it"" view, probably because it has not been conveyed very precisely. let me try to break it down for you. 1. first, it is true *in almost all areas of education* that most of the child's education is the responsibility of the parents. the parents need to show that they value education, they need to practice low-level skills with their kid, they need to check his homework, they need to be reviewing concepts he finds difficult, and so on. when children are failing because they are parents do not have any interest in their education, the school can only do so much. so to say ""some parents might teach life skills, but some people have awful parents!"" does not justify replacing parental instruction with formal instruction. if anything it would justify putting those children in foster care or boarding school, but bad parenting ruins *both* learning in the family *and* learning at school. 2. specifically, some skills rely more on discipline and other skills rely more on explicit factual or theoretical knowledge. the more a skill relies on discipline, the more it needs to be taught by parents. brushing your teeth is an example of low-knowledge, high-discipline. it is very *important*, but you do not learn to brush your teeth every night by studying the *the mechanisms of tooth decay*. you do not need a degree in dentistry to brush your teeth. being forced to brush your teeth *every night* for 16 years, and watching other people who never skip brushing their teeth, makes tooth-brushing into an inflexible habit. likewise with doing the dishes: i had to wash and dry dishes every morning and night from about 6 until i left for college. there is nothing to *learn* here other than the discipline of cleaning the damn dishes. most ""life skills"" are almost exclusively questions of discipline and practice, and so depend entirely on long-term parenting, whereas academic skills rely *largely* on discipline and practice but also require some expertise and knowledge-acquisition. 3. in many cases where there *appears* to be a knowledge-acquisition component to a ""life-skill"", the life skill actually breaks down into two parts - one based on discipline and one based on an academic skill. doing your taxes, balancing your checkbook, or keeping a budget (to use some common examples of life skills people want to teach in school) are self-explanatory *if* you have two skills: first, a firm grasp of basic arithmetic, and second, the discipline to actually recognize that you have to do these things and sit down and do them at the appropriate time. giving someone a textbook description of ""what it means to keep a budget"" is as meaningless as a textbook description of ""proper toothbrushing technique"" or ""the relationship between dish dirtiness and appropriate soaking time"". either you have the discipline to do the chore, or you don't. 4. you may be forgetting that teachers are paid for with parents' tax dollars. in order to justify teaching a skill in the schools, you need to explain why parents would rather pay taxes to hire a teacher rather than do it themselves. for example, it would be silly for schools to hire a dedicated orthodontist to give students braces; having the orthodontist on school grounds does not add anything, and you can easily find orthodontists in their own private practices. having equestrian lessons is not *absurd*, because most parents can't teach their children that and there is knowledge about horses that the teacher could convey to a class, but most parents can't *afford* to teach their children to ride horses, so they wouldn't want it included in the school budget; by making equestrianism an after-school thing, some parents can pay for that kind of lessons and some can't. but why would parents want to pay for someone else to give their kids many of these life-skills classes, when they can work that instruction into everyday life so easily? 5. (and the answer that you are only talking about parents who do not care about their children does not work, both for the reasons i mentioned earlier, and because you do not have to redesign the whole school curriculum to help a few broken families; if the children in broken families need help, and the government wants to help, it can do it outside the schools.) 6. finally, some life skills are hard to teach because *parents do not agree on how they should be taught*, so the school boards prevent schools from teaching much at all. if you had crappy sexual education in your town, that was probably because there were a lot of conservative parents who didn't want them to teach anything *at all*, other than maybe the value of abstinence (for that matter, if there were enough liberal parents who thought that was bs, the school board probably forbade the schools from saying much about abstinence). sex ed is just one extreme example. teaching people about hygiene, personal appearance, cooking - all that stuff has a cultural element that would be hard to introduce into the school curriculum because different families wouldn't agree on anything more than a dry, biological approach to what is clean and unclean, attractive and trashy, healthy and unhealthy, tasty and disgusting. 7. even in areas where there is *factual* knowledge that is broadly misunderstood, and that could help give people the background knowledge they need to understand life-skills better, that background knowledge is often highly politicized. for example, you mention filing taxes. many people get confused by their taxes because they believe urban legends like ""you can end up earning less money total because your income pushed you into a higher tax bracket"". if you had a civics class that taught students pros and cons of different forms of taxation (income tax, capital gains tax, property tax, sales tax, means-testing, fines), and the different ways of structuring income taxes (regressive, flat, progressive), and the rationale for the actual progressive tax system america has, i do not *think* it would be possible to believe these urban legends. but of course, conservatives *like* that people do not understand how the american income tax works and they *like* the urban legend that you can take home less total by earning more, so they would never agree to a mandatory course explaining the justification for progressive income taxes.",cp99lvc,1539.435719242351,1,1425924012,75,19,32549,0,52.73422476973903,1063.0,1621.0,43.0,23,0.046511627906976744,0.0,0.23255813953488372,0.4418604651162791,0.0,0.0,0.046511627906976744,0.023255813953488372,0.0,0.046511627906976744,0.0,0.023255813953488372,0.023255813953488372,0.023255813953488372,0.9069767441860466,0.09928948725532577,0.22295390404515522,0.0,0,0.0,1084,68.28,71.02,12.25,32.09,25.21,23.34,90.41,50.18,10.79,5.44,0.55,0.00,2.49,0.18,2.21,5.35,6.27,13.19,8.67,4.80,6.83,2.21,14.30,5.26,2.77,1.29,1.57,4.06,2.86,1.57,1.20,0.09,0.18,0.37,11.16,2.21,0.00,0.00,0.18,18.17,3.69,2.49,3.14,4.43,1.85,5.07,1.85,0.46,0.18,1.11,2.95,0.74,1.38,0.18,0.55,10.61,2.68,3.04,4.70,0.74,0.37,1.48,10.79,0.28,8.03,0.46,5.26,2.03,11.07,0.46,0.65,2.86,0.00,0.00,0.55,0.28,0.09,0.28,0.00,0.00,18.17,3.78,5.81,0.18,0.28,0.09,0.09,1.38,1.48,0.83,0.92,3.32

t3_33xvlb,"a lot of games considered the best fall into the category of wrpg. baldurs gate, planescape torment, dragon age, mass effect, skyrim, morrowind, the witcher etc. these games, and many other highly regarded games, have to rely on dialogue trees and manually created storyline branches for narration. this is a massive, massive limiting factor to how good the gameplay of these highly dialogue-focused games can get. the characters within the game cannot react to anything that has not explicitly been programmed as a reaction. you have limited dialogue options. you have limited ways of tackling the problems the game presents to you. in particular, romance or character-focused subplots tend to be incredibly stilted by this. modern advances in hardware may be able to fix these issues using artificial general intelligence. imagine an rpg (or other genres if you wish) where your party members can react to anything you say to them like a person would, with varying personalities. party members that can form genuine reactions to the player, from adoration to begrudging acceptance to love, depending on what you say and what you do. npcs that can be debated with. merchants you can negotiate prices with beyond the scope of a minigame. enemies you can convince to switch sides through your own conversational skills. this can go even further if you apply this intelligence to every inhabitant simultaneously across a huge world. no longer do developers have to hard-code the story; the story emerges out of the intelligent actions of hundreds of characters. dynamic economies, cities, political intrigue and diplomacy can create a game world far more immersive than anything that currently exists. agi game developers could even work behind the scenes as the game runs to add new content, tuned to what the player enjoys playing based upon their reaction to current content. in short, ck2 on steroids because you have infinite possible interactions with every other character instead of fixed choices you click on. this is not possible at all now. the very small number of attempts to put npcs you can converse with directly instead of via dialogue choices are so poor as to be comedic instead of realistic (fa?ade is an example of this). i am not even certain that what i said above will happen, but it is certainly within the realm of possibility. agi would create games far superior to anything we currently have. this is why i think a statement like ""the best video game of all time has already been made"" to be false; the potential of an agi game is too great.",cqpizv2,275.61210180327424,1,1430085236,78,36,-15289,0,51.79476266434648,431.0,697.0,24.0,3,0.0,0.0,0.16666666666666666,0.125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.041666666666666664,0.041666666666666664,0.45833333333333337,0.04530759095976487,0.33178654292343385,0.0,0,0.0,435,86.50,82.12,27.83,92.20,18.12,26.67,82.07,49.89,11.03,4.83,0.69,0.23,3.45,0.00,0.46,6.21,7.13,16.09,9.20,3.45,3.45,1.15,11.49,5.52,2.76,1.61,0.46,1.84,5.98,5.06,0.92,0.00,0.23,0.00,11.03,0.00,0.00,0.23,0.00,15.40,2.53,3.91,1.61,3.68,1.84,3.68,1.38,0.23,0.92,0.23,0.23,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,11.49,5.29,2.99,2.53,1.61,0.23,1.38,10.80,0.92,12.18,1.38,8.28,2.53,2.07,4.14,0.23,0.92,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,12.18,5.52,4.14,0.00,0.46,0.00,0.00,0.69,0.46,0.00,0.92,0.00
t3_37956u,"one thing i have not seen mentioned here is that skills tend to be less transferable then we assume. a person who spends thousands of hours practicing and improving their ability to play chess does not actually improve their ability to remember strings of numbers. they might be able to recite back the last 15 moves of the game they are playing, or have the entire board pictured in their head as they play blind folded, yet give them non-related memory tasks and they are no better then average. another thing that has not been mentioned is that when it comes to many skills, people tend to just stop improving after a while unless they put in deliberate effort. the easiest example of this is typing speed. people get better as they type more for a while, and then tend to stall at a relatively low speed unless they deliberately pursue something like typing lessons. when you say that age should automatically equal respect, you bake in the assumption that the older you are, the more experienced you are. what you neglect to account for though is that experience may only matter in a relatively narrow set of situations. let's say i own a bar. if i ask my grandparents how i should market that bar, i am sure they will have opinions to give me. if i ask a guy who has spent the last 2 years studying bar-marketing, he has also have opinions to give me. my grandparents have a lot more general life experience, but the marketer specializing in this field is clearly the better person to defer to. let's say instead of a bar, i have a tech company. we are a software-as-a-service outfit specializing in text-message based marketing. if i ask a group of 60 year old advertising agency executives how to market this, and then i ask a group of 20-somethings who've been doing online marketing for 3 years how to market this, i am likely to get very different answers. the older advertising agency executives might have 30 years each in advertising behind them. they have done radio, tv, direct mail, etc. the younger web solutions group may only have 3 years each, specializing in cost-per-click, web copywriting, web design and usability. i think both groups would have important insights, but i would never ignore the younger web-focused group just because the ad agency has been around 10 times longer. the younger group has more experience with situations very close to my problem, whereas the older group has general, broad-based experience but may or may not understand the nuances of this specific medium. so how does this tie back into what your saying? when it comes to ethical and personal choices, very few people deliberately practice to improve, and so i would expect people's talent there to peak at a relatively young age. i wouldn't expect a 50 year old to automatically be a better authority on moral issues then a 25 year old. when it comes to business or work decisions, although people gain a lot of experience in a certain set of situations, i am not convinced the skills gained 'transfer' as much as we intuitively believe. given all that, there is some merit to the idea that you should only automatically defer to older people in some area if they have a legitiment claim to closely-related expertise. now young people who have no closely-related expertise are in a similar no-automatic respect situation, and if your going to be working together, there is a strong argument to be made that if they do not know very much, they should defer up the hierarchy. but that's not an age based deference, that's a position based deference. that's not so much due to some owed respect, rather that is the case for efficiency reasons. if everyone argues with their supervisors whenever they kind of vaguely suspect they know better, then they will waste a lot of time and energy doing non-productive things. even if the more junior person is right, if the issue is such a marginal one as to make no real difference, then it is not an issue worth bringing up. edit: to quickly add to this, the times i have most often witnessed blatant disregard for the respect deserved to a position was in university classes when mature students were present and monopolizing a professors time during class, and work situations where a younger person is supervising an older person.",crku1nj,987.2168368149231,1,1432605536,73,18,10837,0,51.16350920726137,741.0,1151.0,31.0,2,0.03225806451612903,0.0,0.22580645161290322,0.3225806451612903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03225806451612903,0.03225806451612903,0.2903225806451613,0.0,0.9354838709677418,0.06775733525733525,0.23481781376518218,0.0,0,0.0,765,51.80,63.81,48.56,70.09,24.68,19.74,89.02,52.16,12.16,7.32,2.75,0.65,1.05,0.13,2.75,4.84,7.45,10.59,9.80,5.88,8.10,1.96,16.08,6.01,4.58,2.09,1.70,4.44,4.05,3.14,0.78,0.00,0.26,0.26,11.11,0.26,0.13,0.00,0.52,14.25,2.88,1.83,2.75,4.44,1.18,4.58,1.96,0.39,0.78,0.00,1.18,0.13,0.26,0.00,0.65,9.02,1.96,3.40,3.14,1.31,0.26,1.57,11.24,2.35,13.46,1.18,4.84,7.84,5.62,1.44,0.13,1.96,0.13,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,12.16,3.92,4.71,0.13,0.00,0.13,0.00,1.96,0.00,1.31,0.00,0.00

t3_3dkeyo,"the main reason is that it creates an understanding/mentality that the civil war ""*actually* was not *really* about slavery,"" when in fact slavery was basically the root of all dissent between the north and south. there is an old adage that in elementary/middle school you learn that the civil war was about slavery, in high school you learn that it was not just slavery, but also x y and z so therefore it was not *really* about slavery, but then in college/university you learn that yes x y and z (industry v. agriculture, western expansion, relations with foreign powers, especially the uk and france, etc.) were issues, but that they could all be traced back to the divisive issue of slavery, so it is fair to say that the institution of slavery was the divisive factor in the civil war, and the main reason that the **slave states** seceded from the union. it is also worth noting that you can say the civil war was primarily caused by the question of slavery, while still noting that not all southerners were slave-owning bigots, or that all northerners were abolitionist saints. and by simply stating that the south was trying to ""preserve its way of life"" glosses over the fact that their ""way of life"" rested upon their need to enslave other human beings to maintain it, and is a common staple of confederate apologia. here's a good quote from an askhistorians poster > essentially, the war started over disunion: the south wanted to dissolve the union and the north was willing to fight to preserve it. the war was caused by slavery. essentially all the differences which were large enough to affect the conflict were rooted in the relative presence or absence of slavery: the social differences, the economic interests, the states' rights argument, the political interests, everything. there's also the issue of the fugitive slave law, a federal law pushed for by southern congressmen which required northerners and northern states to hand over slaves that escaped to the north. a northerner in this scenario might claim that southern congressmen were impeding on their own states' rights with overreaching federal legislation, wouldn't it? these southern congressmen were perfectly fine implementing federal laws infringing on ""states' rights"" so long as it meant that they got to keep their slaves.",ct60a1q,691.4695073011746,1,1437095565,24,9,838,0,39.61484887737478,386.0,614.0,12.0,0,0.25,0.08333333333333333,0.3333333333333333,0.6666666666666666,0.0,0.08333333333333333,0.0,0.08333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16666666666666666,0.0,1.6666666666666665,0.11515322912381737,0.2694300518134715,0.0,0,0.0,390,77.33,53.08,23.51,21.82,32.50,22.31,81.79,51.28,11.03,2.56,0.00,0.00,1.03,0.00,1.54,8.46,10.00,12.31,7.18,6.67,6.15,1.28,11.03,2.82,1.03,0.77,0.00,1.28,4.10,1.79,2.05,0.00,2.05,0.00,4.87,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,12.31,2.31,2.56,1.03,1.28,2.56,3.85,0.77,0.00,0.51,0.26,0.77,0.26,0.51,0.00,0.00,12.05,1.03,0.77,9.23,1.03,0.26,5.38,4.10,0.51,11.54,0.51,8.97,1.79,5.13,0.00,0.00,0.51,0.26,1.54,0.26,0.00,0.00,0.26,0.00,0.00,16.92,2.82,5.38,0.51,0.00,0.26,0.00,0.26,2.05,1.54,0.51,3.59

t3_3i3vx9,"okay, first, you are buying into the stereotypical myth that one ""loses everything"" in a divorce. this is not true. what happens is that the assets that were jointly acquired are divided between the two parties. a lot of people are unhappy at having to share with someone they are not having that loving feeling towards. understandable. but the other person is not taking everything from them. yes, there are some acrimonious divorces where there is a bitter battle down to who gets the last fork, but that is the fault of both parties involved more often than not, because they are usually both acting like bitter babies out of hurt and anger and not handling things with any sort of reason or accord. also, you seem to think there is only 1 or 2 reasons for marriages to end. there is many. falling out of love is but one. there is also emotional abuse, physical abuse, cheating, neglect, etc etc etc. if you have invested yourself, not just financially but emotionally as well, and put your everything into it, do you really think the other person should be able to just take whatever they want and walk away? i like that in some countries you have to be separated for a length of time before you are allowed to divorce, because that time can allow for cooler heads to prevail and things can end without all the fighting. that's not to say it is easy, in the majority of cases, there is going to be some pain involved. but when you can step back and catch your breath, it is easier. now on to the alimony bit, which is what you seem to be confused about. a few facts you seem to be unaware of: first, alimony is not automatic. it has to be requested, and then a judge will look at the situation and history of both parties and make a decision from there as to whether or not alimony will be granted and how much. there is about a dozen and a half factors that go into deciding alimony amounts. and there is a reason for alimony. it is not a punishment. it is their to help compensate for unfair economic effects of a divorce. if one spouse sacrificed their career in order to support the other while they pursued their own, or pursued their education, that spouse is put at a distinct disadvantage by a divorce. alimony levels the playing field a bit. if there is no prenup or other such agreement already in place, the court looks at many factors, like the length of the marriage, the ability of each spouse to earn income, the phsyical, financial, and emotional states of each party, and so many more. then the amount and length of time the alimony will be paid is decided. also, you seem unaware that marriage is legal contract as well as an emotional commitment. when one party breaks that contract, there is legal ramifications. you cannot make legally binding commitments and just walk away from them...and if you have any integrity at all, you do not make any sort of commitment or promise and then just walk away without expecting to make some recompense. and no one is kept in a marriage by these threats you speak of. if they stay because they are afraid of divorce, that's their own choice and they are making themselves miserable. the courts will divide the assets, not the spouses, and there will be some losses for both sides. that's how life works. when you build something together with another person, you do not get to just take all the marbles and leave when you decide you do not want to play any more. you both contributed, and you both stand to lose some of what you built.",cud5nsy,442.70126773991467,1,1440366497,38,6,6770,0,66.48635563380284,639.0,924.0,36.0,3,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.16666666666666666,0.7222222222222222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027777777777777776,0.0,0.027777777777777776,0.027777777777777776,0.1111111111111111,0.0,1.1944444444444442,0.041426827141112864,0.21752738654147105,0.0,0,0.0,642,48.05,73.85,41.96,13.19,18.34,18.07,91.59,58.26,12.46,6.23,0.16,0.00,3.74,0.00,2.34,6.23,6.39,13.86,10.28,6.23,9.50,2.96,16.67,3.43,2.02,2.18,1.87,5.61,7.17,3.12,4.05,0.62,1.56,1.09,12.31,2.34,0.00,0.00,0.00,16.67,2.96,2.49,1.40,5.14,2.02,6.54,1.56,0.31,0.31,0.62,0.93,0.31,0.47,0.00,0.00,7.17,2.80,1.71,1.87,1.09,0.93,0.78,14.33,1.56,11.53,1.87,6.23,3.58,1.87,1.09,0.00,1.25,0.16,0.00,0.62,0.00,0.00,0.31,0.31,0.00,12.62,5.76,5.76,0.16,0.00,0.16,0.00,0.00,0.31,0.47,0.00,0.00

t3_2xk11d,">we live in shared societies, and issues that affect one will have affects on the other i think this is really the crux of the issue. feminism, especially third wave feminism, is all about tearing down traditional gender roles, something that can only help women *and* men. i will go through the issues you raised as being more important to men and show how it is an issue that feminism is actually fighting against right now. * prison rates why are men so disproportionately thrown into prison? well, part of it is a toxic idea that men are more hardy than women. judges and juries may subconsciously be easier on women when sentencing because they are a woman, and so need extra help or protection. they see men as strong and women as weak, men as aware and accountable for their actions and women as little kids who didn't fully comprehend what they were doing. feminism hates all of those ideas. by making it accepted that women are not the ""weaker"" sex and bringing the genders to true equality in the eyes of the law and society, rates of incarceration should even out. really, this idea is central to a lot of other points you brought up. *violence i assume you mean homicide rates being significantly higher for men. this again stems from a toxic masculinity that permeates our culture. think about the quintessential man portrayed on tv or in movies. he would fight for his woman's honor, is not a coward and so would fight for his own honor or dignity, is not afraid to do what he needs to do to get by, even if that includes violence. some people argue that men are more violent by nature, but i completely disagree. domestic violence affects men just as much as it affects women, but again, we have this poisonous idea that men are strong and women are weak, so society ignores every instance of a counter-example to that. if we can help destroy these ideas that men are strong, physical, aggressive beings, we can help eliminate violence by raising more non-violent children by showing them that they do not need to prove their worth through fighting, which is silly. * homelessness this basically touches on the same things as the prison one. men outnumber women in homelessness quite a bit, and it is partly because we see men as the more competent sex and women as the weaker ones. so if a woman is out on the street, we worry for her safety, we think she has just down on her luck, we think she may have been mistreated by a man. she gets extra help from charities through women-only shelters, or gets more sympathy from others because she has more willing to ask for help. if a man gets put on the street, society sees him as a failure, he has someone who could not pay his bills or hold down a job, he probably does drugs or something. he has also less likely to ask for help because that would be a sign of weakness or admitting he has failed. tear down the idea that a man's worth is tied to his economic success and we can start seeing homelessness as a serious problem instead of an inevitability. * homosexuality i guess i do not see how this affects men more. lesbians are routinely discriminated against just as much as gay men are. could you elaborate here? * law see prison rates above. * sexuality this is a really interesting one to me. think about women exploring their sexualities. it is usually totally kosher, as far as society is concerned. there are ""lesbians until graduation"" and countless examples of women experimenting in the media. but find any instance of a straight man doing *anything* with another man and it will either be some shameful secret of his or a sign that he has actually completely, 100% gay. this one drop rule comes from our modern definition of manliness, which is basically just a negative. a masculine man is not feminine. you can't be a true man if you act anything like a woman, including exploring our sexuality. so we get straight guys who are curious about the same sex and they mentally kill themselves over it, thinking they are secretly gay instead of just thinking they are a normal human being. and bisexual men are still much more stigmatized than bisexual women. if you look through a list of any out bi celebrities, the vast majority will be women, because it is not yet acceptable for a man to sit somewhere in the middle of the kinsey scale. * sexual crime think about the culture we are in, the one that says that men are absolute pigs re: sex. that every man will want sex at the drop of a hat, that it is always on his mind, that he will do literally anything just to get laid. the idea absolutely saturates television and movies. with ideas like that, it is not surprising that things like male rape are ignored. men can't be raped, they want sex all the time! if these shitty gender roles didn't exist, we would see quite clearly that men are more than just sex-seeking automatons and women are these dour creatures who deign to provide sex to their more primal partners. * fatherhood and fatherless homes women are by default seen as the caregivers. i have heard plenty of people say that mothers are better parents than fathers. it is a ludicrous idea, of course, but it is a prevalent one tied to the gender roles in our society. if men are seen as just as competent parents as women, they will not be stigmatized for being single fathers. and if we can instill the idea that men can be just as good of parents as mothers, then perhaps the rate of single mothers would drop. * depression and suicide men are stigmatized for seeking out help. they are supposed to be strong, work things out for themselves, and, worst of all, not feel emotions. so a man is depressed? he just needs to figure that shit out. we also still have stigmas against mental illness and therapists. someone with a mental illness is crazy, and anyone who needs to see a therapist is on their last limb, instead of just someone who needs the help of a doctor. but if we can help men express their emotions better, maybe we will not have as many cases of untreated depression which can lead to suicide. if we help men realize that asking for help is not a sign of failure and that they are allowed to ask for help, maybe there will be fewer suicides. * transgenderism like homosexuality, this does not strike me at all as a men's-only issue. care to elaborate? * circumcision i'm pretty confident that most feminists are against circumcision. they probably do not directly advocate against it, but they are still probably mostly of the opinion that genital mutilation is bad. this is probably one that i think is sincerely a men's-only issue. * soldiers do you mean that men have to sign up for the draft and women don't? feminists oppose the draft at all. do you mean that more men are in the front lines than women? feminists want to let women do what they want in the military, including fighting on the front lines. *mental illness see depression above. * cultural and societal norms see like, everything above. if you are referring to gender roles, you have already acknowledged that feminism seeks to tear those down. * masculinity and how it is defined this ties into gender roles as well. feminism does focus on femininity, because it is a movement for women, but it does not ignore men either, especially when there are men in the movement. as i said above, masculinity right now is kind of a negative as far as it is defined. a masculine man is not weak, he is not emotional, he does not care about his appearance, etc. a better definition of masculinity needs to come out, and it should come from men, but i do not see why it has to be something that arises separate from feminism. that's really the crux of all of this. you said yourself that third wave feminism emphasizes intersectionality. well, men are part of that. there is no reason men can't help solve their own issues (which are related to feminist issues) within the realm of feminist ideals. and as for your entertainment sites, they are just that. if you have a problem with how they are portraying feminism, send them an e-mail explaining why, stop visiting their site, and find one that's more in-line with your ideas.",cp0u39m,4325.649768730305,1,1425222260,1049,21,9183,0,62.49865463321606,1463.0,2179.0,81.0,3,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.19753086419753085,0.1728395061728395,0.0,0.024691358024691357,0.0,0.04938271604938271,0.012345679012345678,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012345679012345678,0.0,0.580246913580247,0.07180600649350652,0.20027341079972658,0.0,0,0.0,1470,47.15,87.62,9.30,13.74,18.15,18.71,90.82,56.19,14.42,7.01,0.88,1.43,1.09,1.70,1.90,7.35,5.65,13.67,10.61,5.99,7.82,1.97,16.26,7.28,4.69,1.50,0.88,3.27,5.92,2.38,3.27,0.20,1.22,0.48,17.41,0.68,0.20,2.65,5.17,15.92,3.20,1.56,2.45,4.08,1.84,5.37,1.70,1.22,0.34,0.14,2.99,0.27,1.16,1.56,0.07,8.10,2.86,1.09,4.63,0.95,0.68,1.16,13.33,0.82,7.76,1.43,4.83,1.50,1.09,0.48,0.14,0.48,0.07,0.27,0.41,0.14,0.00,0.07,0.20,0.00,13.74,5.03,4.90,0.07,0.00,0.41,0.07,0.54,0.27,0.88,0.14,1.43
t3_39vjw8,"most holidays are hard to justify on paper. why celebrate someone's birthday? it is really just an arbitrary marker that bears little on an individual's actual development. christmas is a scam. halloween is a scam. easter (if you are not religious) is a scam. mother's day: scam. on and on. but you know what? i like these days, i do not care if they were pushed into being by cold and uncaring corporations. they are a part of our culture, and we chose to make that so. you could say that companies were just responding to a need (days of celebration) evidenced by how well they were received and embedded into the fabric of our culture. there are many 'holidays' you have never heard of, because they were never accepted by the public at large. the ones we celebrate, we celebrate for a reason. ignoring the consumerism for a moment, what i find important about these days is it does give you time to reflect. mother's day makes us ask ourselves ""have i been showing my mom how much i love her?"" in the day to day hustle of life, it is easy to lose track of these things. ideally, we would never need a day, we would just be thankful and appreciative all year round. but we tend to be focused on our own needs most of the time. father's day helps raise our awareness about what it means to be a good dad, or a good son or daughter for that dad. i'm not going to try convincing you to love father's day, but i would urge you not to ""hate"" it. my dad actually sounds quite a bit like you, and honestly it saddens me the way he is. he is so hyper aware of social manipulation of this kind that he loses perspective. he takes on a cynical attitude towards these trappings and so becomes less emotionally receptive as a result. he thinks he has rebelling against culture, but really, he has just rebelling against his own family, closing off one small avenue to help strengthen bonds. in the end, he accomplishes nothing with his rebellion in terms of reshaping culture, and ultimately starts to seem more a curmudgeon than anything. being in such vehement opposition to something as trivial as a holiday does not make you brave or heroic, it just makes you an ass (not saying this about you personally, just in general). your view of the world shapes reality. if you see father's day as consumerist bullshit, that is exactly what it will be for you. you will act in such a manner as to make it so. it is very easy to pick up on the vibe of your parents and respond in kind. your kids could have had an opportunity to be extra loving on this day with you, and you could respond in turn. but alas, you are simply too above it. too above a good excuse to be a bit kinder to each other. is that really something worth fighting for? is that the person you want to be? is that how you want your kids to be? just try this. be stupid for a day. on father's day, take it just as seriously as marketers would like you to. get excited about all the gestures of kindness, material or otherwise, and make your appreciation clear to your family. you will be surprised to discover, that forced excitement and appreciation becomes real. what was before only a formality, becomes a catalyst for real emotional connection. when your family sees your warm reception, it will make them happy, which in turn will make you happy. instead of reinforcing a cycle of cynicism, you are now reinforcing a cycle of love and kindness. does it actually really matter how the day came about? you have an opportunity here, fucking *use it*. life may ultimately be meaningless, but each day we have the ability to create real meaning for ourselves, our friends, and our family. father's day may be bullshit, but it also represents one small opportunity to find true meaning. not just find it, but to make it. to fail to understand this is to fail to make the best use of this short time we have. ^(this post sponsored by hallmark.)",cs6yty8,385.6801214235003,1,1434378723,71,18,9935,0,70.84845847114052,721.0,1039.0,52.0,3,0.057692307692307696,0.038461538461538464,0.17307692307692307,0.11538461538461539,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.019230769230769232,0.057692307692307696,0.0,0.4615384615384615,NaN,0.23578363384188628,0.0,0,0.0,721,46.36,92.92,27.85,84.48,13.87,18.17,92.79,59.22,17.48,10.40,1.39,2.36,4.44,1.53,0.69,7.07,5.96,14.56,9.85,6.80,6.66,1.53,17.34,5.13,2.08,1.66,0.28,1.94,8.04,5.69,2.36,0.00,1.25,0.55,16.09,2.50,0.14,0.69,2.64,16.64,4.02,3.47,2.22,2.77,1.25,4.72,1.80,0.83,0.55,0.55,0.97,0.14,0.28,0.14,0.00,9.71,4.72,2.50,2.50,1.66,0.55,1.39,13.18,1.11,11.10,1.11,5.13,4.85,1.39,1.53,0.55,0.55,0.28,0.00,0.69,0.55,0.00,0.00,0.14,0.00,15.95,6.24,4.85,0.14,0.00,0.97,0.00,0.00,0.55,1.66,1.11,0.42
t3_32kk7u,"i think you are misunderstanding the point of intersectionality. intersectionality is meant to disrupt the disproportionate prioritization of white women's issues, not to say that racism and sexism are the same. it is also not meant to *quantify* oppression as you seem to suggest. it is meant to make feminists mindful of the fact that gendered oppression takes a *different form* for people of various races and classes and sexual orientations, and that in order to properly address sexism, you have to consider those different forms instead of holding on to the naive belief that if you fix wealthy white women's problems, you automatically fix all women's problems. it seems like you seem to think that intersectionality divides women rather than builds solidarity. but what you are missing is that early feminism (and some forms of liberal feminism now) was *already exclusionary to women of color, of low ses, trans women, etc.* intersectionality is meant to be a way of being more inclusive, of *building* solidarity that did not exist before. acknowledging the variety of women's experiences is the only thing that *allows* for genuinely finding the common forms of oppression that women share rather than simply assuming what applies to one group applies to all. that generates ""solutions"" that only help a specific subset of women, and the subset that is generally better off anyway - and sometimes solutions that actually are harmful or further the oppression of other subsets of women. if you need to ignore the roles that race, class, and sexuality play in the gendered oppression of women simply because it is not part of your own experience, that's not solidarity at all.",cqcax2g,1127.5348219128816,1,1429043442,99,13,-9945,0,34.755782608695654,276.0,470.0,10.0,14,0.1,0.0,0.4,0.1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1,0.0,0.0,0.1,0.0,0.0,0.7999999999999999,0.0981718898385565,0.2644927536231884,0.0,0,0.0,276,77.80,65.50,35.93,15.56,30.67,23.91,82.61,50.72,12.32,3.62,0.36,0.00,3.26,0.00,0.00,8.70,5.43,15.58,6.52,4.71,5.43,1.81,12.32,6.88,4.71,0.72,0.36,3.26,3.62,1.45,2.17,0.00,0.00,0.72,9.78,0.00,0.00,3.99,0.00,19.20,6.88,2.17,2.54,3.62,1.81,6.88,2.17,1.09,0.36,0.00,0.72,0.00,0.00,0.72,0.00,5.07,1.09,1.09,2.17,0.72,0.72,2.54,10.14,0.00,7.25,0.00,4.71,1.81,0.72,0.36,0.36,0.36,0.36,0.00,0.36,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.36,15.22,3.62,4.35,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.36,0.72,1.81,0.72,3.62

t3_3iladn,"> involuntary manslaughter pertains to where the charged actually took part/caused the killing, and the girl did not do either. in this case she had to engage in ""wanton and reckless"" conduct. there is no ""took part in"" element of the crime, just a causation factor. the actus reus - the element that requires an action - is the conversations she had with him over time. if it can be proved that she *caused* his death (for example, by repeatedly counseling him to get back in) by intentionally committing ""wanton and reckless conduct"" (for example, by encouraging him to kill himself and telling him how to do it without any regard for how this endangers his life), then she meets the key elements of the crime in her jurisdiction. we can see the likely intent given the resoluteness of her texts to carter and her response to his friend (""you're not going to steal my idea, are you?"") this works part-and-parcel with our historical view that suicide is, at least, some form of battery. ma also [defines involuntary manslaughter](as "" a battery that the defendant knew or should have known created a high degree of likelihood that substantial harm will result to another."" (cursory source because i am at work.) this is not the theory the prosecution is using but i think it is fair to raise in addressing your general claim. i say ""key elements"" because i do not know where the defense is trying to poke holes. the da's response to the motion to dismiss suggests that the elements being argued are the character of her conduct (wanton and reckless) and causation (because it *can* be argued that there is a tenuous connection between her dictates and his actions.) i do not think we should categorically bar involuntary manslaughter when someone is gung ho about another person committing suicide. there is definitely room for argument and that's what courts and juries are for. if someone latches onto a person with suicidal tendencies, nurtures that feeling, coaches them on how to kill themselves, and continues to counsel and encourage them until the commit the act, there should, in my opinion, room to present to peers that this individual was acting with a reckless disregard for human life and, but for those acts, the person would still be alive today.",cuhdr4h,421.5811102725767,1,1440683172,66,9,1015,0,49.870588946459435,386.0,597.0,15.0,72,0.06666666666666667,0.0,0.2,0.6666666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.0,1.2,0.025684001670843774,0.2927461139896373,0.0,0,0.0,390,59.37,77.14,4.03,15.03,26.00,22.82,84.10,56.92,15.13,8.72,1.79,0.77,0.77,4.62,0.77,6.41,7.44,13.85,9.49,4.36,7.69,1.79,14.10,1.79,0.77,1.79,0.00,2.31,4.36,1.79,2.56,0.00,1.54,0.00,12.82,0.26,0.26,2.82,2.31,15.38,2.82,4.87,1.54,3.08,1.28,3.33,1.03,0.51,0.26,0.26,1.03,0.00,0.77,0.00,0.26,5.38,2.05,1.03,0.77,1.03,0.51,2.56,10.51,0.77,8.72,1.03,5.13,2.82,1.28,0.51,0.51,0.00,0.00,2.82,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,18.21,3.59,4.10,0.00,0.00,0.26,0.00,1.03,3.08,0.77,3.33,2.05

t3_3c7bxx,"""it's the cost of doing business"". if a business owner does not like their clientele, they are more than welcome to simply stop doing business. (main difference from slavery is that business owners can walk away.) alternately you can stop doing business with the general public and become a private store/club instead and only serve your members. non-discrimination laws are no different than being required to accept currency, building handicap accessible buildings/accommodations, or even not being allowed to be open during certain hours. in the areas that have them it is simply part of the environment of doing business in that area. what the argument boils down to at an individual level is ""i doan wanna."". (it may help to imagine that said in the voice of a pouty 3 year old to get the full effect. on a more macroscopic scale it boils down to whose ""rights, responsibilities, and or privileges are more important"". in the cases alluded to the responsibility of the public shop owner is to serve the public. if they posted that they didn't do certain designs (like a confederate flag or a swastika or a burning cross, or effigies of presidents for example) and then refused to do that design, they would still be serving the public and not compromising whatever artistic/workmanship integrity they have. that's fine. but to arbitrarily refuse service to certain members of the public is not. even without legal rationale... if you open your business, skills and talents for hire in a community... then you need to accept the business of all of the community. not just the parts that you like. because if we allow businesses to do that as a community, it tears apart the community. this is not to say that you can't have standards such as a dress code which theoretically anybody can meet, or income requirement etc. but those are not based on who somebody is. just what they happen to have at the moment.",csswyf9,103.84762147676413,1,1436117120,535,49,-22780,0,56.80654101995569,328.0,523.0,22.0,9,0.0,0.0,0.18181818181818182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045454545454545456,0.0,0.045454545454545456,0.0,0.0,0.09090909090909091,0.0,0.36363636363636365,0.07142857142857142,0.2682926829268293,0.0,0,0.0,332,69.77,66.35,27.82,80.39,15.81,22.29,89.46,57.83,12.65,5.12,0.30,0.30,2.11,0.00,2.41,7.53,8.73,14.46,10.84,3.01,6.93,3.01,13.86,3.92,3.01,1.81,0.30,1.51,4.22,3.61,0.60,0.00,0.30,0.30,13.25,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,14.76,1.81,1.81,2.11,4.52,1.20,8.13,1.20,0.00,0.90,0.30,0.60,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,9.34,3.61,0.30,4.52,0.60,0.60,0.90,10.84,1.20,9.34,0.30,6.02,3.01,6.33,0.60,0.00,4.22,0.00,0.00,0.30,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,16.57,7.83,3.01,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.30,1.81,1.20,1.51,0.90

t3_3c7bxx,"businesses have the right to refuse service to any individual for any reason. they do not have the right to refuse services to protected classes of individuals based on their belonging to that class when they provide those services to other equally qualified customers. the first is about individuals. if a black gay female comes into my store, acts like a complete and total jerk i can toss them out for not being someone i want to do business with. i can refuse service because i do not want to be busy that day. i can refuse service because i do not like them individually. i can refuse service because i just feel like it. the second is about groups of people. i can not refuse service to black gay females because they are black gay females. i can not withhold services from a person for reasons that have nothing to do with them individually and result only from my assumption of their inclusion in a particular group. the reason for this is simple but multi-faceted and rests on a few bits of reality that people do not like to think about sometimes: 1) businesses exist because of civil society. there is a reason somalia is not a libertarian utopia even though there is absolutely no government interference in business. it is because there is no civil society at all that businesses can not function there at all. this is more than just about government and law enforcement too. governments allow the existence of a high functioning civil society: working infrastructure for business; schooling so that businesses have literate employees; working financial systems by which to transact business; means for customers to move from business to business safely to conduct transactions; and so forth. however, governments are not the sum total of a high functioning civil society. this requires more than a government. syria has a government. but the people of syria are not free to live their lives unencumbered by unnecessary interferences in their lives. the question is what interferences are necessary and which are not. civil society, in the experience of history, seems to work best when all members of society can decide that question together; and with their collective, rather than individual, best interests as the focus. 2) because business depend on civil society, civil society has authority to tell businesses what they can and can not do in order to maintain that civil society. this includes following laws that limit the freedoms of businesses. businesses, just like individuals, have to respect the rights of others. you can not intentionally harm other people for no justifiable reason. while you can punch someone in self-defense, the legal defense against that charge is a positive defense not a negative one. that is, you can't say ""self defense"" and walk away. you generally have to be able to show that it was self-defense. you can punch someone in the face. but if you do not have a reason for doing so that society accepts as valid, you have violated their rights and exceeded your own. likewise, businesses can't do things that are obviously harmful to society, such as dumping raw sewage into the public drinking water. 3) one of the lessons of the civil rights movement is that ""separate is not equal."" for civil society to work we all need to have reasonable access to the aspects of society that make society function as a civil society. it is a violation of an individual's rights to execute their own life to preclude them from society on the basis of basic discriminatory practices of the majority. we can't simply say we do not want black people in our schools, or that gay people can not drive on the roads, or that women shall not have access to jobs. and again, we know that civil society is more than merely the collection of government functions. it does not matter if black people have access to the same rights as white people if there are no black people in the area because no one will do business with them outside of the government. 4) civil society, while dependent upon government is more than government. through the 1900s people exercised their ""individual freedom"" to refuse business to those in minority groups. the results were segregated communities where black people simply could not live. no one would sell them a private home because the mortgage clauses came with rules against reselling the homes to black people. no one would sell them food, because the local grocers wouldn't do business with ""those people."" no one would treat them if they were sick and injured, so they would die without proper medical care unnecessarily. none of this involved the power of the state. but the collective actions of individuals of the majority precluding minorities from participating in civil society created significant civil strife and endangered civil society's continued existence. 5) ergo, the people of the democratic republic demanded that civil society address the issues of lack of inclusion of minorities. the result was that civil society decided collectively that businesses were free to exist and operate within civil society but one of the personal rights they could not violate was the right to not be discriminated against based on membership in a protected minority. now, this law has plenty of controversy around what should and should not be a protected minority. however, there is absolutely zero basis for any contention that civil society, upon which a businesses ability to exist depends, lacks the authority to set such rules. further, the experience of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries demonstrates quite clearly that failure to consider overt discrimination a crime resulted in significant social harms that negatively impacted civil society in a way that was considered unacceptable, and legitimately threatened it is continued existence.",cssy476,369.44165374353133,1,1436119605,535,49,-20295,0,46.89987628865981,970.0,1608.0,50.0,19,0.1,0.0,0.18,0.26,0.0,0.0,0.02,0.02,0.02,0.0,0.0,0.02,0.04,0.0,0.6600000000000001,0.13298945952007177,0.2020618556701031,0.0,0,0.0,976,74.05,61.30,12.30,25.77,19.52,26.64,87.50,52.77,10.45,4.92,1.23,0.51,0.82,0.00,2.36,5.53,6.86,14.86,9.12,3.89,5.64,4.10,11.99,4.20,2.46,0.92,1.74,2.46,3.59,1.74,1.74,0.10,0.51,0.10,12.50,0.00,0.00,0.41,0.00,14.34,2.36,3.28,2.15,2.25,1.43,5.64,1.54,1.02,0.20,0.10,1.95,0.20,1.02,0.41,0.41,7.89,1.43,1.54,3.89,0.61,1.33,1.02,11.17,0.20,6.97,0.92,4.51,1.43,6.35,0.20,0.41,3.18,0.00,0.10,0.20,0.00,0.00,0.20,0.00,0.00,10.86,5.12,2.77,0.20,0.51,0.00,0.00,0.31,0.82,0.61,0.51,0.00

t3_36600k,"[this](is an interesting article that covers much of what you are saying. the first half of the article covers the general stereotypes that you talk about and the second half goes over why those stereotypes are really more of a perception problem from older generations. the article really comes down to this: ""efficiency is at the heart of the perception gap about millennials."" in a world drowning in information, their m.o. is to cut out the extraneous."" efficiency is the big issue and millennials have their own way of dealing with this problem because of the tech they grew up with. you say they are lazy but it is not so much they are lazy but that they have a different view of how and when work needs to get done. like the article says we (i'm kind of at the edge of the millennial according to the article at 32 years old) do not view the work day as being in an office for 9-5. most of the work today can be done remotely and we do not understand why we have to be in a cubicle to do it. i have wifi at home, in a cafe, or even in a park in some cities. i can get work done just as easily, and for me more efficiently, in those places than i do in the sterilized office environment. this tends to be the case for many millennials, we are so inundated with noise and information that the silence often found in offices are unnerving. we also tend have a better understanding of when we are most productive due to growing up in a world where you are always connected to teachers, co-workers, and bosses. i, for example, am a morning person and am most productive between 8am -12pm so i try to be in the office during that time. after 12 i crash hard and often find myself staring at a blank screen or writing and deleting the same sentence over and over again (i work in pr and marketing by the way). instead of taking a lunch break and getting back to it, i instead eat, go to the gym, and head home. i then eat dinner and open up my laptop and get back to work at 6 or 7pm and work until midnight or so and then go to bed. if my boss was not understanding she would think i was lazy and blew off work. also, the emails with attachments of completed work at 10pm let her know that i am putting the time in. it just happens to be on my own terms and this tends to be a huge problem for people that are used to a more traditional work day. edit: by the way i wrote this post while working on homework (working on my 2nd bachelors degree), writing a press release, developing a survey, and putting together a case study about kitchen incubators. all of which i plan on having done or close to it before my gf gets home at 9 tonight. i am also doing this on a saturday sitting on the coach while playoff hockey is on in the background. to older generation this may seem like madness but many millennials have grown up in an environment where juggling all of this is normal.",crb95vi,265.19989194275746,1,1431806615,91,10,17936,0,68.72750379746839,553.0,756.0,25.0,3,0.16,0.0,0.2,0.2,0.08,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04,0.0,0.0,0.16,0.0,0.8400000000000001,NaN,0.21880650994575046,0.0,0,0.0,560,79.57,45.73,81.72,15.69,23.33,15.36,89.29,58.39,11.61,7.14,3.93,1.07,0.71,0.36,1.07,4.46,8.57,17.68,9.11,5.18,8.57,0.71,15.54,3.57,3.21,1.61,1.79,2.32,1.79,0.54,1.25,0.00,0.00,0.00,5.18,0.00,0.18,0.54,0.18,10.18,2.14,1.43,1.07,2.86,0.71,3.39,2.50,0.71,0.89,0.36,1.43,0.36,0.00,0.00,1.07,9.64,1.61,3.93,2.50,1.25,0.54,2.14,13.39,0.89,18.39,1.61,11.07,5.71,5.71,0.71,1.07,0.18,0.00,0.18,0.36,0.00,0.36,0.00,0.00,0.00,10.71,4.46,3.04,0.36,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.54,0.54,0.18,1.25,0.36
t3_36600k,"research/ data delivery! you requested some empirical non anecdotal data on the apparent lack of a work ethic in millennials. one thing the findings seem to indicate it is less of a lack of work ethic and more so a perceptual issue around what is consider hard work. another point that i found intriguing; if you reframe your thinking from ""millennials are not meeting the same working standards as older generations,"" to it is the fault of the currently established institutions for not properly understanding nor leveraging the particular strengths of the workers, the entire debate shifts. namely that labelling and stereotyping a generation of people as lazy or bad at hard work is essentially victim blaming. the rigidity and refusal to acquiesce to employees with a new set of skills and a different personal and professional point of view creates a hostile environment in which millennials are ill equipped to thrive in. >you can curse them for what they?re not, or you can leverage them for what they are. ?millennials tend to be self-confident, creative, optimistic, energetic, social-minded, and highly innovative"". these characteristics can reap huge rewards for employers who are willing to understand the total package they come delivered in."" >forced early on to recognize that hard work and a good education don?t necessarily lead to economic security, members of this well?educated group say their responsibilities to their families and their personal aspirations will take precedence over professional goals. family and personal authenticity are all key aspects of this cohort?s personal identity, and they are frustrated with companies and corporate structures that refuse to evolve to allow them to live up to those aspirations. >overall, millennials regard businesses? approach to leadership as perhaps too traditional or inward-looking. while they believe the pursuit of profit is important, that pursuit needs to be accompanied by a sense of purpose, by efforts to create innovative products or services and, above all, by consideration of individuals as employees and members of society. anyway you get the idea. i hope this helps. there is tons of research and data on the subject. i could have found you at least a dozen more peer reviewed articles and papers but i am on my phone. fascinating stuff nonetheless. sources: ",crbb4hs,225.4949832989957,1,1431810747,91,10,22068,0,40.04964396284831,374.0,649.0,19.0,1,0.0,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.2631578947368421,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.10526315789473684,0.0,0.5789473684210527,0.032484567901234565,0.3716577540106952,0.0,0,0.0,381,84.93,79.21,13.69,55.46,20.05,29.66,84.78,47.77,11.29,6.04,1.31,0.00,1.84,0.00,2.89,5.25,6.04,15.75,5.51,2.62,7.35,1.05,10.50,6.56,3.15,1.31,0.52,3.15,7.61,3.94,2.36,0.26,0.79,0.00,11.55,0.52,0.00,0.00,0.00,13.12,3.67,2.36,1.57,2.62,2.10,2.89,2.36,0.52,0.52,0.79,0.52,0.00,0.52,0.00,0.00,14.70,2.36,4.99,5.25,2.62,1.31,0.52,10.50,0.52,8.14,1.31,4.72,2.10,8.40,0.52,0.52,0.79,0.00,0.00,0.52,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.26,0.26,12.34,4.46,3.94,0.26,0.26,0.26,0.26,0.79,1.05,0.00,0.00,1.05

t3_31uukt,"the bottom line is that in any sort of system that tries to reflect the preferences of the crowd/the citizens/the users, there is no way to do both of the follow: 1. forbid people from ""voting against"" some option just because they want it to fail 2. treating extremely popular positions (that have many supporters and no detractors) differently than extremely divisive positions (that have many supporters and as many, or more, detractors). if you have a tool to express the fact that you are opposed to a position, then you can use that tool to punish positions to manipulate results. if you do not have any tool to express opposition, the most divisive positions will always appear to be the most popular ones, because you can always get more supporters by adopting a more extreme position (the people who like the extremism will vote for you, and no one else can do much about it, until you get to the point where you lose more moderate supporters than you gain extremist supporters). overall, the advantages of toning down extremist, polarizing positions are larger than the reverse. i think if you look at the most popular comments on large threads (especially threads where most people will only see ten or so of hundreds of top-level comments), you will see that they are *generally* comments that express a divisive opinion, because flashy, extreme positions tend to attract immediate support from extremists, while the majority of people who disagree or are neutral will tend to respect the intent that they not ""downvote"" simply to show disagreement. > i do have genuine distaste towards the reddit downvoting system because it can be see so easily abused by the many various fans on different subreddits to eliminate criticism. any voting system that can be *used* can be *abused*. ultimately reddit's up/downvote system seems to be popular. many of the ""downvote brigade"" subs have clarified that their purpose is to mock people, not downvote them, and are actively experiment with rules both to discourage the downvoting-mentality and to make it inconvenient to downvote. the problem *may be* self-correcting, over the longterm. even if it is not self-correcting, it is not necessarily a problem. it can be a breath of fresh air for people to see that their subs are attracting attention from elsewhere, and for people to think not only about how people in their sub understanding what they wrote, but how it looks to others. this also cross-fertilization, hybridization, and prevents self-imposed isolation. one of the problems with the second phase of the internet (call it 2003-2013) was that online communities were growing up that were both very good at encouraging interesting projects that were consistent with the group mentality, but which were also very good at policing and controlling the group mentality, creating an echo-chamber effect. ultimately, ""brigades"" are just about internet points, which are irrelevant, but when dozens of leftists visit a rightwing sub, and then dozens of rightwingers turn right around and visit the leftist sub, - that's great! that's exactly the sort of thing that makes reddit such an interesting idea. likewise, when economists realize that if they say anything that's historically wrong there will be historians coming to laugh and them, and vice versa for economics, that's a great thing! i think the most troubling development is not actually downvotes, but the attempt to mask the meta-sub behavior and cut off this dialogue, or make it a one-way dialogue. some of these meta-subs now have rules that are designed to prevent totesmetabot from alerting a redditor that he has been linked from elsewhere on reddit, and many (almost all?) of them have rules preventing the target from confronting the people who are ridiculing him and tainting their fun. obviously that is cowardly. anyway, my point is that giving people the ability to express dissent is actually a great thing if it encourages people to communicate with people they wouldn't want to talk to in a traditional internet forum that *only* rewards conformity, and punishes dissent with silence and bans. > i for one feel this practise does not provide any incentive for support of development of people's opinion. not only that but we should place equal value in everyone's opinion, whether you like it or not, and as such the system eliminate people's free will to comment, as the negative vote system allows for people's comments to be deleted. i do not think it actually *deletes* them, it just hides them. which can save time in a non-controversial thread where people who simply gave the wrong answer to a simple question got downvoted, and it can equally save time in a controversial thread where i want to go *directly* to the sharpest, most confrontational exchange. there is a difference between valuing people's opinions in the sense of *allowing them to post*, valuing their opinions in the sense of *reading them, thinking about them, and engaging with them,*, and valuing their opinions in the sense of *agreeing with them*. obviously you can't think everyone's opinions are *equally correct*, since in most cases redditors will disagree with one another. if you think one redditor's comment is high-value^(meaning ""correct"") you must think some other redditor's comment, which disagrees with the first, is low-value^(meaning ""incorrect""). likewise, millions of comments will be posted on reddit today, and unless you spend an equal amount of time reading, thinking about, and replying to every single one, can you really pretend you think they are equally valuable in *that* sense? so if you agree that there are important senses in which some comments are worth more, and some less, then both the upvotes and downvotes have value in identifying those posts. > when considering that development can only really take place through criticism, it causes long term problems of a lack of change and then they will complain about things becoming stale. verbal comments that say ""i disapprove"" are one form of criticism. downvotes are a non-verbal form of criticism. they add an interesting quantitative dimension, a sort of (limited) reality-check to the qualitative content of the comments. on the one hand, it is good that hundreds of people who would otherwise have to right ""i approve"" or ""i disapprove"" can just vote instead, because (a) an actual *tally* of the votes is better than the vague impression we get from looking at comments, and (b) it is a waste of time for them to write, and for us to read hundreds of identical comments. make sense?",cq59ckw,832.2673910002992,1,1428501104,17,5,11055,0,43.273607500532705,1083.0,1733.0,39.0,23,0.1282051282051282,0.02564102564102564,0.20512820512820512,0.38461538461538464,0.0,0.02564102564102564,0.05128205128205128,0.02564102564102564,0.02564102564102564,0.0,0.0,0.02564102564102564,0.1282051282051282,0.0,1.0256410256410258,0.11732403134044816,0.22253000923361035,0.0,0,0.0,1107,68.09,72.44,18.94,61.75,28.38,25.38,87.71,52.12,12.29,5.42,0.90,0.27,1.72,0.18,2.35,6.87,6.87,13.46,8.67,5.06,6.68,1.54,14.27,4.79,3.07,1.90,2.08,4.34,7.68,4.79,2.89,0.00,1.08,0.45,11.02,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.18,15.63,3.25,2.35,1.90,4.16,1.81,4.61,1.99,0.81,0.36,0.27,0.54,0.18,0.00,0.00,0.36,6.78,0.90,1.26,2.62,1.45,1.26,1.08,11.74,1.45,9.03,0.81,6.05,2.08,0.99,1.26,0.00,0.54,0.00,0.00,1.08,0.00,0.90,0.09,0.00,0.09,18.97,3.07,5.78,0.09,0.00,0.27,0.18,1.54,1.63,1.36,1.99,3.07

t3_345dqx,"i agree with you that a great deal of the problem with repetitive questions is not the rules banning them or the people breaking the rules, but insufficiently strict/consistent moderation where the rules are clear. however, this does not actually support your view: it only suggests that banning posts that do not use the search function could work *even better than it does now* if it were enforced consistently. > just about every possible unique question has been asked in some form. if that is true, then that should mean that every possible unique answer has been provided in some form. if you can find threads in which people asked your question and then realize that the answers are the answers you want, problem solved! if you can find these threads and realize that people who asked the *same* question *didn't* get answers that are useful to you, you will realize that you need to ask a *different* question, which is even more useful. maybe this different question has been asked: but more likely it has not. bam. > there can be new insights to an old question. there *can* be, but it depends on what kind of question you are asking. many questions are extremely simple and only appear complex to an outsider because he knows *zero* about a topic. but the answer is clear and only requires him to do his homework. you can't ask any question at all and defend yourself by saying ""i was not sure whether there might be a cool new answer or not!"" the regulars already know, and that's why they told you not to ask that question. now, in some rare cases the question *can* be discussed in different ways, but in that case... why do you need a *new* discussion of it? why not read all of the *old* discussions? they are no more or less likely to have great insights: probably more likely because people were more excited by the topic before it became repetitive. read all *those* threads first, and if you still want an answer, come back when you understand the topic better and you understand how to start an insightful discussion of it. why would those old insights be useless to you? that seems somewhat narcissistic, like a comment only matters if the commenters were responding to wonderful, marvelous *you*. > the only real way to get a discussion going is for a new post to be made this is the question: when and why should there be a new discussion? every subreddit wants to have great new discussions, but they have different attitudes on what rules achieve this. the goal is to ban threads that lead to *bad discussions* in favor of threads that lead to interesting discussions. sometimes the topic is a bad one because it brings out lots of misinformation: sometimes the topic is a bad one because it devolves into trolling: sometimes the topic is a bad one because the answers are all boring and just require the op to do some freaking background reading: and sometimes the topic is just *boring* and predictable, and the op needs to read older threads to familiarize himself with how these things go so he can find a juicy new angle. you can say, ""well if the thread is bad it will be downvoted, no one will participate, do not read it if it does not interest you, etc."" but that's how you get a shitty, shitty subreddit. (or discussion forum of any type.) it is the same reason why most good subs ban memes: there is a lowest-common-denominator problem where the best threads are, even at their best, only attractive to 1% of the people browsing, but the stupidest threads require no attention or concentration so they are attractive to, say, 30% of the people browsing. we all like the same stupid things, but when it comes to complicated things we focus on different issues, so as a result a forum can get clogged with memes, trolling, cheap puns, crowd-pleasing rhetoric, and stupid but common concerns. there are certainly barely-moderated subreddits that do not control any of these: go there and stay there if you are convinced that's valuable. but in practice you do not want to ask stupid questions on a crappy sub: you want to go to a sub which is extremely valuable, and has a large audience of attentive, civil, competent human being, and ask your stupid questions there, right? and the problem with that is that if they let anyone do anything they wanted, it wouldn't have been a well-functioning forum in the first place, there would be no audience, so there would be no one to answer questions or discuss problems with. you correctly observe: > replying to old posts is meaningless ... but that is only true relative to new posts *on well-regulated subs*, where almost every post will get polite, helpful replies, and commenters who will reply back if you have follow-up questions.",cqrneod,868.9427791298862,1,1430246013,26,7,-8975,0,60.00995652173914,828.0,1202.0,35.0,23,0.0,0.02857142857142857,0.4,0.7714285714285715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08571428571428572,0.08571428571428572,0.0,1.3714285714285714,0.15596774909058642,0.17753623188405798,0.0,0,0.0,837,35.22,74.07,27.67,38.52,23.91,19.83,90.32,55.56,12.43,5.38,0.24,0.24,3.35,0.60,0.96,7.05,7.17,8.84,11.35,7.53,8.12,2.39,17.92,7.77,3.46,2.75,1.19,3.11,6.45,3.58,2.87,0.00,0.96,0.24,12.19,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.60,22.94,6.21,2.75,3.82,7.65,2.15,6.21,1.19,0.60,0.36,0.12,0.24,0.24,0.00,0.00,0.00,5.85,0.36,1.67,1.91,1.91,1.31,2.39,14.46,1.31,9.20,1.31,3.58,4.06,2.03,0.00,0.12,0.12,0.00,0.00,1.31,0.48,0.24,0.24,0.36,0.00,17.56,3.82,5.14,1.31,0.00,0.60,0.24,0.84,0.48,0.72,0.24,4.18

(the most extreme stuff, like fascism, does, but hardly anyone sane supports that.) right-wing politics rather believes that people know most about their own lives and will ultimately make the best decisions about how to live it. this includes how people allocate their resources (e.g. money and time). and they do not believe that people are basically selfish, because they honestly think that if you reduce taxes, people will give more to charity. combine this increased funding for charity with an efficient free-market and you end up (in theory) with affordable healthcare for everyone. > how do right-wing people justify their politics when they literally cause some people to fear for their lives? do you genuinely believe that left-wing politics has never made anyone fear for their lives? the left's refusal to consider nuclear energy has probably killed a lot of people, because it led to more co2 being pumped in the atmosphere. somewhere in the world, people have been denied good medical treatment because the bureaucracy surrounding it went terrible (for example, the best treatment for my adhd is something i can't afford because of the red tape surrounding getting your drug approved for government help in paying for it.) if you are going to make statements such as ""right-wing politics literally cause people to fear for their lives,"" you are going to have to qualify what part of right-wing politics you are talking about, because there are plenty of right-wing policies that do not do that and a decent amount that makes people's lives better than their oppositional left-wing policies. > are right-wing politics inherently selfish? sometimes, but not most of the time.",csw3vb7,3623.483171058434,1,1436362387,692,66,1883,0,58.31889003153711,748.0,1141.0,39.0,6,0.07692307692307693,0.02564102564102564,0.1794871794871795,0.23076923076923078,0.0,0.02564102564102564,0.0,0.05128205128205128,0.02564102564102564,0.05128205128205128,0.0,0.0,0.02564102564102564,0.0,0.6923076923076924,0.0748249299719888,0.196524064171123,0.0,0,0.0,771,49.28,65.63,37.36,65.10,20.84,21.92,90.14,52.66,12.84,7.00,0.39,0.13,2.33,0.00,4.15,5.71,4.28,14.14,9.60,6.61,7.39,2.72,17.64,9.34,4.93,1.43,0.00,4.67,7.13,4.41,2.33,1.43,0.13,0.00,11.15,0.00,0.13,0.00,0.13,17.77,2.98,3.89,1.56,3.89,1.04,6.49,0.78,0.52,0.13,0.13,1.95,0.00,1.69,0.00,0.26,7.26,0.78,1.69,4.41,1.56,0.13,2.33,13.23,1.43,10.77,1.17,7.91,1.69,4.15,0.00,0.00,2.98,0.13,0.26,0.26,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.26,0.00,17.12,4.54,4.02,0.13,0.00,0.52,0.00,2.98,0.78,0.91,1.56,1.69

t3_304vk8,"i think you can approach this from 2 angles: first, the reason people have the drive to reproduce is biological - it is how our species survives, something that is so ingrained in us that it is one of the most powerful motivators we know. there must be some minimum number of people who *are* having biological children, otherwise we would cease to exist. maybe you do not have a problem with that, but that is basically saying ""existing is selfish"", and by that logic, there is no non-selfish reason to continue living. if you were really interested in being selfless, you would stop consuming resources and cease to exist (obviously extreme, but you get my point). second, in relationship to how many people there are in the world, the percentage of ""extra"" kids (that really should be adopted, whether because of financial reasons, orphans, etc) is not tremendously high, especially in 1st world countries. that does not mean that adopting an orphan child from a 3rd world country is not a *good* thing to do, because it is. but we are really talking about situations at the margins here, rather than something everyone should be doing. the other category of objections is more along the lines of wanting to be a good parent and have a good relationship with your child. that really is a bit of a crap-shoot, but you seem like a thoughtful person, and that goes a long way. also, it wouldn't really change your odds (especially not for the better) if you adopted a child. that is likely to be a harder situation especially if the child was much different than you, so those objections, as points against having a *biological* child, do not really make that much sense.",cpp57rx,256.9420391010039,1,1427214238,295,42,-22414,0,55.019445828144484,292.0,431.0,11.0,5,0.18181818181818182,0.09090909090909091,0.45454545454545453,0.6363636363636364,0.0,0.2727272727272727,0.0,0.2727272727272727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2727272727272727,0.0,0.0,2.1818181818181817,0.03337662337662338,0.2191780821917808,0.0,0,0.0,295,35.34,63.27,28.70,37.78,26.82,19.66,89.49,61.69,13.90,5.76,0.68,1.69,3.39,0.00,0.00,8.14,7.80,11.53,13.90,7.46,7.12,2.71,17.29,4.07,3.05,1.36,1.36,3.05,3.39,2.03,1.36,0.00,0.34,0.00,11.19,0.34,0.00,0.00,0.00,21.36,3.73,3.39,4.07,3.39,2.03,9.15,1.02,0.00,0.34,0.34,1.69,0.34,0.34,0.00,0.00,9.83,2.71,1.69,2.71,2.03,1.36,0.68,12.54,0.00,8.14,1.36,5.08,1.69,2.03,0.00,0.00,0.34,0.00,0.00,0.34,0.34,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,18.31,3.73,7.46,0.34,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.02,1.36,0.34,2.03,2.03

t3_3eoxzt,"i understand that my post here is supposed to change your view, but i think i will try to correct your understanding a bit. wwe calls itself 'sports entertainment' which is meant to be a hybrid of both. the most accurate description would be that it is athletic performance art. that said, i would argue that it is competitive. highly competitive. the competition is not decided by how much you win, but by how much money you make the company through tickets, changes in tv ratings, subscriptions to their network, and merchandise sales. this is very different from other scripted kinds of entertainment like movies or tv shows. an actor may want to prove himself on a tv show, and get better billing, but you are not really competing with someone for a spot because the lead has already been cast. what are they competing for? the same thing they are competing for in the storyline - the world championship. the world champion gets the biggest pay cheques, the most time on tv, and the longest matches with the best opponents. so every week as the wwe produces content, they watch their metrics. fan reactions, ratings, ticket sales, and just whether or not they get that 'it' factor from a wrestler. and in a big roster, everyone wants to be the champion. and they do crazy shit to be there. they do [crazy]([ass]([stunts](they wrestle despite having incredible injuries (often from said stunts) because time spend off means you are that much further away from the title, and they do endless media appearances and wrestle several times a week all year round. because if you slack, someone else gets to be the champion, and gets the glory and the paycheque. so even though its scripted, being the champion is as big a deal to a wrestler as being a superbowl champ is to a football player. so yeah. wrestling is not a sport. but it is not quite what you think it is. it is competitive, dangerous, and very much its own creature.",cth0aqr,218.77570933962505,1,1437972084,13,5,1345,0,72.51364369501468,341.0,478.0,22.0,2,0.0,0.0,0.18181818181818182,0.22727272727272727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.40909090909090906,NaN,0.2756598240469208,0.0,0,0.0,345,55.53,53.48,18.64,69.48,15.68,20.87,89.28,55.36,13.91,6.96,1.45,0.00,2.32,0.29,2.90,6.96,9.28,10.43,9.57,4.35,8.99,1.45,15.07,6.09,3.77,1.74,0.00,3.19,5.22,3.77,1.45,0.00,0.58,0.00,7.83,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.29,16.81,2.32,3.48,1.45,3.48,1.74,5.80,2.32,1.74,0.58,0.29,0.87,0.87,0.29,0.00,0.00,8.41,0.00,5.80,5.80,2.32,0.29,2.03,11.59,0.87,7.83,0.87,4.35,2.32,5.51,4.06,0.00,2.32,0.00,0.00,0.87,0.58,0.00,0.29,0.00,0.00,17.10,6.09,6.09,0.00,0.00,0.29,0.00,0.29,0.00,1.16,1.45,1.74

t3_2xl4rw,"the word ""discrimination"" has a long history. original it meant (primarily) telling the difference between two things. we still use it this way sometimes - for example, when we say someone is a ""discriminating judge"" or has ""discriminating taste"", it is always a compliment - but in our century, ""to discriminate"" sees neutral use only in formal contexts. apparently it was a victim of the euphemism treadmill: bigots began describing bigoted behavior as ""discriminating"", ie ""noticing the differences between people"", to draw attention away from the fact that it was morally dubious, and so as a result ""to discriminate"" came to mean ""to treat different people differently, in a morally dubious way"". but a *third* sense evolved, later on, when the us federal courts had to decide what, exactly, the civil rights laws banning discrimination *meant*. they read the laws according to the doctrine of *protected classes"" - that is to say, that purpose of civil rights laws was not to ban *all* forms of differential treatment, or even to ban all *morally dubious* forms of differential treatment, but to remedy historical mistreatment of certain groups of people whose civil rights had been denied to them. these were the ""protected classes"" and, while the courts were not trying to change he meaning of the *word ""discrimination""*, they did rule that in cases of ambiguity, federal anti-discrimination laws were to be interpreted narrowly to protect those classes. so we have three senses: a technical-etymological sense, a (nearly universal) ethical sense, and a legal sense. none of the senses is wrong, you just need to make sure you are using the terms the same way. it sounds like you are somewhere between 1 and 2: any kind of differentiating between people is *potentially* discriminatory, and it actually *is* discrimination if it is also morally dubious. but it sounds like they are using something somewhere between 2 and a loose version of 3: if it picks out a protected class to the disadvantage of that class, it is potentially discrimination, and if it is also morally dubious, it *is* discrimination. just move into more basic terms if you want to have these conversations. or ask them what they mean by ""discrimination"" at the very beginning.",cp15lwr,123.40856353984285,1,1425244970,93,18,7491,0,38.34130663856692,365.0,604.0,13.0,23,0.15384615384615385,0.07692307692307693,0.38461538461538464,0.23076923076923078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07692307692307693,0.0,0.15384615384615385,0.23076923076923078,0.0,1.307692307692308,0.22039903680770553,0.23013698630136986,0.0,0,0.0,370,74.34,64.75,23.96,35.20,28.46,25.41,82.70,51.89,12.43,4.32,0.00,1.35,1.08,0.27,1.62,7.57,7.84,13.78,7.57,4.86,7.30,0.81,14.59,3.78,2.70,1.35,1.89,1.62,2.16,1.35,0.81,0.00,0.00,0.00,8.11,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.27,19.73,4.05,2.43,1.62,6.76,1.89,5.95,3.51,0.27,1.08,0.27,0.27,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.27,7.03,2.16,1.08,2.43,0.00,1.62,4.05,8.65,0.54,8.65,1.08,4.32,3.24,2.97,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,24.32,3.51,6.49,1.08,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.35,6.22,0.00,1.08,4.59

t3_3295fa,"i have a problem with some of this stuff. first off, it ignores the communist revolts against the vanguard party. yes, they declared that they were doing things on the behalf of the people, much like the french revolutionaries before them. the problem is that people objected like in the vend?e or the russian peasant armies they were met with violence. lenin was complicit with launching coups against representative government and violent suppression of people seeking to protect their own interests. he did so while at the same time calling out labor union leaders for not recognizing that their own interests and objectives differed from those he led, never once realizing that the precise same dynamic was playing out with the vanguard party and communism in general. rather than coopting these other movements and incorporating the views of others they simply recreated a new autocratic political system modeled on imperial russia. this is not uncommon in revolutions: when the english killed king charles i they recreated first a military dictatorship and then reinstituted the monarchy, when the french revolted against the tyranny of their absolute monarchy they let absolute power fall into the hands of a small handful of radicals and eventually into the hands of one dictator. it turns out that autocratic and even tyrannical power is really, really useful for those who are in power. lenin fell into a common trap. instead of laying the groundwork to establish a stateless society he instead let the tyrannical tools and power of the old regime fall and be crushed by the people he immediately took it up and sought to use it to remake the world around him, just like the czar before him and made the rise of a man like stalin inevitable. it's also important to note that many nations exploded in wealth and power. france, germany, belgium, and dozens of other nations were destroyed by a world war. others such as czechoslovakia, poland, austria, hungary, and dozens of others were created from the corpses of those nations killed by that same war. yet the 1920's was a time of remarkable growth across the board. the ussr was not even remarkable. it was only when the ussr was less impacted by the great depression that they bucked the trend, and that was largely because they were recovering slower and indeed lost to their neighbors in the prior decade. no one here is arguing that russia should not have been a great power. they had been a great power for some time. but, the question here is whether or not russia did great *because of* or *in spite of* their political and economic leadership. there's a great deal of reason to suspect that it was *in spite of*. if you look at agricultural production you see some pretty serious losses in productivity with collectivization. this has been repeated time and time again. in the soviet union in the 20's and 30's. again in the 50's in hungary and czechoslovakia. china's experiences with 5 year plans and the great leap forward. then again in the socialist ujaama villages in east africa during the 70's. the mechanism being employed weren't just inferior to capitalistic production, but *inferior to the traditional production that preceded it*. the rejections of the value of local knowledge, the subordination of productivity to ideology, and fundamental flaws in marxist economics for no other reason that it failed to develop to accommodate new data because it was crushed under political orthodoxy that began with lenin. industry was always the focus of communist states. there were massive gains in this category, but that can arguably be a case of something being superior to nothing. you saw massive and impressive expansion of industry largely from scratch. imperial russia had functionally nothing. china less so. both of these nations had demographics that made great power status inevitable but they were held back by backward and incompetent political leadership and economic structures. but even at their communist peaks soviet products were always at a design disadvantage (especially for consumer goods), the incentives in the system were designed to promote an orthodoxy over productivity or quality, productivity was never equal to that of their rivals, and even when trade was possible you had things like yugos trying to compete with toyotas. compare south korea and japan to the track of north korea or russia. marx was a decent economist for his time, but you have to realize that the theory that he was working on was ricardian. the premises he was working from were wrong. monopolies are not inevitable, but there are some conditions that promote them. with the proper incentives they can be prevented from forming. usually monopolies we see are those with massive barriers to entry, often times the regulatory burdens just compound the problems inherent in running wires the to compete with comcast. odd, because *some* planning has been successfully integrated into capitalist economies, but systemic economic shortages is more often experienced by economies attempting centralized planning. *with perfect information* then a centrally planned economy *might* work out better *for the central authority* but long experience has demonstrated that putting that much power over capital in the hands of a small number of people ends badly. i doubt that horse unemployment is really a thing. you see, the primary cause of a lack of rising wages in the west is largely a function of those jobs moving to developing nations, and people in those nations moving into industrial or service industries from subsistence agriculture. it is less that technology is resulting in fewer jobs, but rather that people who were previously excluded from having any jobs at all are now being included for the first time. employers are not the only ones who decide the wages. when they have all the market power they can approach it, but wages often rise over the objection of owners when the value of labor rises. more generally standards of living tend to be higher when people have more control over their own surroundings, rather than delegating that power to some third party. the problem is that the political elite and economic elite are not necessarily the same people in a capitalistic society. whenever you have a vanguard party taking over that is absolutely the case. everything is a ticking time bomb. as long as there is a structure that structure will collapse. communism is a structure so whenever it is in place it would also be a ticking time bomb. the problem is that capitalistic alternatives tend to both have *less* concentration of power and be *more* capable of adapting to challenges. capitalism will eventually collapse because entropy. eventually it will morph into a form that cannot survive or because people will just decide to try something else. the problem is that the problems that marx identified didn't result in the collapse of capitalism when it ""should"" have simply because the form of capitalism that existed adapted properly to meet those challenges. as long as capitalism is made to work then it will continue to persist. vanguard-led revolutions that do not allow themselves to decompose into something fluid and cede power to their own people are far too rigid and incapable of adapting and will always collapse

t3_31whne,"> however, we are both former english colonies that are democratic, cultural melting pots located next to each other on the same continent. actually, canada takes more of a ""cultural mosaic"" approach to immigration in that immigrants are encouraged to maintain their own culture when coming over. the melting pot is an american concept where does not matter where you come from you are american when you get here! > ""but our accents are totally different!"" no, they are not. i have never heard a single canadian speak with that stereotypical accent. i have actually heard canadians scold americans for thinking that they all talk like that. some of them might, but that's a regional thing, like with people from north dakota or wisconsin. there is no ""stereotypical canadian accent."" canada is the second largest country in the world and accents vary heavily by region. newfies sound almost irish, quebeckers speak french, and there are more subtle differences from central/western canadians. > i just do not believe that that applies to canada must be true then /s > another claim is the whole quebec thing, but i am not sure how well quebec jives with the rest of canada. from my understanding, quebec is striving for political autonomy due to their cultural difference from the rest of canada, so i am speaking for the majority of canada when i draw comparisons to the us. your understanding is very poor. the separatist sentiment in quebec has cooled significantly in recent years. in the last federal election the separatist party had an embarrassing showing (i think they got two seats of like 300+?) and are essentially on the brink of collapse. also, quebec has a population of over 8 million and represents a large portion of the canadian population. > i am sorry if there is some sarcasm in my tone, but i am just so sick of just being scolded by people who instinctively refute my claim out of fear of seeming ignorant themselves. as a canadian, i find your level of ignorance insulting and i am not surprised you are scolded. if there is a sure fire way to piss off a canadian, it is to compare them to americans. not that we think you guys are horrible or anything, you are our closest ally, but we take pride in doing things a little differently up here. other differences: * we apologize for everything. you can run into someone in canada and they will apologize. * on the whole we are a more socially progressive society (equal rights for gay couples have been around for a long time.) * we are very fond of our universal healthcare system * we are proud of our country, but not in the way that some americans are. being a smaller country we obviously do not consider ourselves as ""the greatest nation on earth"" or anything like that. * we behave differently (generalizing here, obviously not always the case) when travelling in different countries (i.e. learn a little bit of the language, do not assume everyone speaks english, etc.) * hockey is religion up here. baseball and basketball are not very popular. the nfl is awesome though, thanks you guys. * high school and university sports are not really followed at all. athletic scholarships are not really a thing. * there is not the same obsession with ""top schools"" and whatnot in canada. some schools have a better reputation than others, but the difference between universities in canada is much less pronounced. but as a final point, it is very disingenuous to compare all canadians under the same culture. the culture in vancouver is very similar to that of seattle or other western cities. you wouldn't describe the culture of the south of the u.s. as the same as new york. newfies are a completely different breed, and the culture of small towns in canada is much different than the big cities. if you do not want to be treated as ignorant, do not make such sweepingly ignorant statements... edit: formatting",cq5oyf6,1569.2357465116859,1,1428525824,192,35,4641,0,58.14634097775337,662.0,1044.0,44.0,1,0.022727272727272728,0.0,0.20454545454545456,0.4318181818181818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022727272727272728,0.0,0.045454545454545456,0.022727272727272728,0.75,0.051988321755763615,0.25075528700906347,0.0,0,0.0,665,61.97,54.20,69.50,30.87,16.22,24.06,82.86,55.04,11.88,7.52,2.11,2.26,1.80,0.00,1.35,4.36,7.37,13.53,9.77,6.17,6.32,3.01,13.53,8.72,6.17,1.20,0.90,3.31,4.21,2.26,1.95,0.60,0.45,0.15,10.53,0.00,0.45,0.00,0.30,14.44,1.80,0.30,0.90,2.86,2.26,8.27,1.35,0.15,1.05,0.15,0.45,0.15,0.15,0.15,0.00,7.22,2.86,0.75,3.01,0.90,0.00,1.05,11.43,0.60,12.78,0.75,9.62,2.41,1.35,0.90,0.15,0.30,0.15,0.00,0.45,0.15,0.00,0.15,0.15,0.00,16.54,6.47,3.91,0.30,0.00,0.15,0.30,0.00,1.50,0.30,1.20,2.41
t3_31whne,"alright, so my perspective is from that of a newfie family (family is from a province called newfoundland), who grew up in ontario, and now lives in northern alberta as a tradesman. - universal healthcare: when someone is sick, you get help. americans are always on reddit talking about how much they have to pay out in hospital bills, and stuff like raising money for treatments is completely unheard of. (breaking bad, the whole premise of the show, would not exist in canada) - our units: we use the metric system, but we are trapped in this half way thing because of the us. as a heavy duty mechanic i still rely on ""standard"" wrenches just as much as metric. we weigh ourselves in pounds and say our height in inches, but use kilometers for everything else. - french: it is an official language spoken all across the country, mostly in ontario, quebec, and new brunswick. everything has to be bilingual, except in quebec, where street signs, directions, everything is exclusively french, and businesses have actually gotten into trouble for having english and french on signs. - black people (keep reading, not racist): i noticed every time i have gone to the states that black people have that typical accent that we always see in the movies. that does not really exist in canada (sort of, but not quite to the same degree if at all) all of the black people i usually meet do not speak like most do in the us, and usually have a french accent, or english is not their first language. also americans seem to get offended if you call someone ""black"" - employment: full time employees usually get an array of benefits, maternal leave is a right, and 2 weeks vacation, a lot of places in western canada give 3 weeks vacation. americans seem to work to the bone and get fired for all kinds of bullshit. - suing people: people do not sue everyone here. we have ""good samaritan laws"" so if you injure somebody giving them cpr, you are protected. - police: people do not get their houses raided because they have a bunch of pot or some cocaine on them. jails are not privatized for profit. i am not anti-police but in the us i know for a fact that they do not go through the same sort of psychological evaluation and training than the cops here. - human rights: gays have been allowed to marry, and be recognized as common law, nation wide for a long time now. most places allow women to be topless in public. there does not seem to be such a high amount of racism and police brutality toward visible minorities. *i am half native myself and have family on a reserve so read below with a grain of salt* - the dark side of canada: we have a long history of putting aboriginal people in residential schools which were similar to concentration camps. then sanctioning them off to native reserves. this has created a lot of native reserves being known for a lot of bad shit, and creating cultures within these reserves where the natives hate white people, and feed off of the welfare system, become alcoholics, and abuse drugs. this has also created racism toward natives all across canada. - religion: (probably mostly applies to the bible belt in the us) there really are not people here who deny evolution, or go out with signs saying the world is about to end. it exists, but in very small numbers. most people i have ever met are agnostic, the people who were religious never really said anything about it, didn't shove it in your face or anything. being atheist brings zero backlash, nobody cares. politicians do not use religion as a prop for anything. even our own prime minister, who is christian, has never really said anything about gay marriage, even when they reopened it for debate a few years ago. - our accent: we do talk differently. we say ""out"" and ""about"" or ""house"" very differently. in western canada they pronounce about as ""a boat"" and in ontario it sounds more like ""a bout"" as in ""i had a bout with cocaine in college."" people from newfoundland and most of the east coast have very unique accents. heavily influenced by irish and welsh accents, they use a lot of old english and unique slang. you simply can't describe it. watch this video for newfie accent, it is a bit exaggerated on purpose but thats pretty much how my family talks: - our words: we say ""kraft dinner"" instead of ""kraft macaroni and cheese."" it also says it right on the box, and we seem to love it. nobody says freshman, sophomore, etc. we just say grade 9, grade 10, grade 11. *this is off topic to most people, but for people like me this is the car culture part of canada* - japanese right hand drive cars: only have to be 15 years old vs 25 years old in the us. this leads to a lot of people owning right hand drive vehicles and has created its own subculture in iteslf. it is cheaper to buy a car in japan and have it shipped here than buying one here. especially since japan always had high performance versions of cars that were sold everywhere else, that were only sold in japan. there's a lot more but that's what i got so far.",cq5xy82,984.152996251803,1,1428539909,192,35,18726,0,63.14514158305464,897.0,1309.0,45.0,1,0.06666666666666667,0.0,0.2222222222222222,0.3111111111111111,0.0,0.022222222222222223,0.022222222222222223,0.022222222222222223,0.06666666666666667,0.0,0.022222222222222223,0.0,0.022222222222222223,0.0,0.7777777777777779,0.039034608068698975,0.2686733556298774,0.0,0,0.0,906,66.41,69.42,54.92,27.61,20.13,16.45,84.55,52.43,11.70,5.85,1.55,2.43,0.66,0.00,1.21,5.85,5.85,14.90,7.84,6.62,6.95,2.21,14.35,4.30,2.98,1.32,1.32,3.20,2.54,1.32,1.21,0.00,0.55,0.00,11.26,0.77,0.00,0.22,0.00,14.13,1.32,1.99,0.44,4.53,2.21,5.30,2.98,1.21,1.32,0.33,2.10,0.66,0.66,0.22,0.66,8.28,3.53,0.88,2.54,1.10,0.44,2.76,11.26,0.11,14.02,1.43,8.94,3.53,3.09,1.10,0.77,1.21,0.77,0.00,0.55,0.22,0.22,0.11,0.00,0.00,17.55,4.97,5.30,1.43,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.55,2.43,0.44,0.99,0.44

""causing the least amount of grief"" is utilitarian, which means that it tries to maximize something generally perceived as good (i.e life, pleasure) or minimize something generally perceived as bad (suffering, death, or grief in this case). there are multiple schools of thought for and against this: for instance, deontology is the idea there are moral absolutes. for example, if you ask me where my family is so you can murder them, i am morally obligated to tell you where they are because lying on my part is inherently wrong. some say that we have infinite obligation towards the ""other,"" or other people/ another person; so even if an action results in, say, extinction, if you ask me to do it for you i must do it, for you. other commenters have already said that you can't calculate grief and pleasure, and some people react to things more or less than others. what this means is that, yes, your definition of utilitarian ideals is true, but in practice, it is not necessarily moral. 2. reality is subjective, which means everything, including morality, is also subjective. subjective, according to my highly qualified google search, is defined as ""based on or influenced by personal feelings, tastes, or opinions: dependent on the mind or on an individual's perception for its existence."" think about it: people's personal opinions, perceptions, experiences, et cetera, shape how they view the world and what they think of it. thus, our differences in views mean our realities and ideas are also subjective, and all our man-made thoughts, like those on morality are also subjective, meaning morality cannot be objective. hope i was able to change your view. philosophical work on morality: immanuel kant, ""critique of pure reason"" john stuart mill, ""utilitarianism"" soren kierkegaard, ""fear and trembling"" emmanuel levinas, ""totality and infinity""",cr9iv5x,226.22870052438068,1,1431655334,99,17,16353,0,43.75592039800998,335.0,556.0,15.0,1,0.26666666666666666,0.06666666666666667,0.13333333333333333,0.4666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13333333333333333,0.13333333333333333,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4,0.03914656771799629,0.2865671641791045,0.0,0,0.0,339,31.78,64.94,47.66,10.76,22.60,25.66,85.55,53.39,17.70,8.55,2.95,1.18,3.24,0.00,1.18,9.14,2.95,11.80,8.85,4.72,9.14,1.47,14.75,4.42,2.65,2.36,1.18,3.24,5.90,2.06,3.24,0.59,0.59,1.18,11.21,0.29,0.00,0.00,0.29,21.24,5.60,3.24,2.36,5.31,2.65,7.37,4.13,1.18,0.88,0.29,0.59,0.00,0.29,0.00,0.29,5.01,1.47,1.47,0.59,0.59,0.88,1.47,13.27,0.29,7.08,0.88,4.72,1.18,1.47,0.29,0.29,0.00,2.36,1.47,0.29,0.00,0.00,0.29,0.00,0.00,24.19,4.42,10.91,1.77,0.29,0.00,0.00,0.29,4.13,0.88,1.18,0.29

t3_3ekjn3,"canada has a very different collegiate system to the usa. and we have a very different racial make-up as a result of us not really having had the same numbers of slaves or the same violent opposition towards civil rights. we also do not see quite the same level of disparity between racial groups socio-economically. our disadvantaged minorities are less disadvantaged than those of the us. so our universities do not really implement racial quotas quite the same way as the united states does. in canada the closest thing we have to affirmative choice is universities' treatment of aboriginal students - sometimes qualifying under separate categories and getting additional funding support. and that's contentious too, but it is not made to punish other people, it is really meant as an effort to help counteract the additional challenges faced by aboriginal students in obtaining an education. one of the best ways to help aboriginal populations in general is to remove as many barriers to education as possible - people who are empowered and well-employed are great for their community. they are leaders and examples for youth, they are often able funnel money back into their communities for development, they are often better able to service their communities. setting aside spots for them is not meant to remove spots for white kids. it is not. aboriginal students who make it to university often had to attend rougher schools on or near reserves. they are more likely to grow up in foster care. they are less likely to have university-educated parents. just imagine that you are a highschool student living with your paternal grandmother - a woman who attended residential school. she didn't receive a great education - she probably left the moment she was able to because residential school was a shitty time for a lot of students and they got schooling that was far below the standards set for other students. when you are raised in an environment where school is a scary, violent, abusive force it does not necessarily breed the same academic support. there are all these barriers that stack up together to make it really hard for them to get into the same programs. aboriginal special acceptance programs are not meant to punish poor or disadvantaged non-aboriginal kids. they are simply meant to help provide clearer avenues for aboriginal students to access education. i think that's what affirmative action looks to do in the us. affirmative action is not perfect. you get advantaged kids in any race. but it is one of the best tools we do have for helping poor and depressed groups help themselves. admitting their kids to universities helps them lift their communities up and that's worth the imperfections in the system.",ctgdi0f,215.50353833370784,1,1437912828,59,8,42972,0,46.13591523178812,453.0,762.0,25.0,6,0.04,0.04,0.08,0.16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32,0.0843031968031968,0.2737306843267108,0.0,0,0.0,458,73.82,79.66,26.59,37.35,18.32,24.02,87.34,51.31,12.01,7.21,0.22,1.97,0.87,0.66,3.49,4.80,6.55,14.63,9.39,4.37,4.80,2.18,14.63,8.52,4.80,1.31,0.44,1.97,6.33,3.49,2.84,0.22,1.31,0.22,13.54,0.66,0.00,1.09,0.22,12.45,2.18,1.53,0.00,3.28,0.66,5.46,1.09,0.66,0.00,0.44,0.44,0.22,0.22,0.00,0.00,14.85,4.80,2.40,7.42,2.84,0.66,3.06,11.35,0.00,10.04,1.75,6.55,2.18,7.21,0.00,0.44,1.31,0.00,0.00,0.44,0.22,0.00,0.00,0.22,0.00,9.83,5.46,1.31,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.97,0.00,1.09,0.00,0.00

t3_30kxn3,"what people generally refer to as ""freedom of religion"" is this: > congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; i think that makes the reciprocal nature of the two phrases clear, no? freedom of religion is effectively freedom *from* religion - that is, freedom from a state-run religion. however, if we *merely* establish freedom from religion in the negative sense that the state can't *encourage* one religion in particular, we are still vulnerable to the situation where the state *discourages* every religion *except* for one in particular, and ends up imposing an official religion on us simply by hamstringing the competitors. your second paragraph makes the central point perfectly well - given that if any religion does something bad we can criminalize that act, what further grounds for religious intolerance could we have that was not a direct attack on either speech or association? and indeed, that is why the passage continues: > congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. these are, collectively, freedom of expression and of thought. but each specific element of the first amendment is interwoven with the others such that one freedom can't stand while the others are denied. freedom of speech is, if you understand it in its fullest and most abstract sense, the only freedom of expression you need, but if you just interpret it narrowly as the freedom to *talk*, to make noises, then you can control what people say in print and in other media, and your freedom to make noises suddenly means very little. everything you are saying about freedom of religion could be said about freedom of the press... do not the other freedoms of expression clearly indicate that the printing press should also be free? ... or, why give a right to petition for redress of grievances, is not a petition a printed letter, which is covered under freedom of the press? so to return to the original point - there may be ""penumbrae"" of the forms of freedom of expression which *are* explicitly mentioned in the first amendment which are logically entailed by the list of freedoms, but the fact that these shadow-freedoms exist does not mean we should relegate an explicit freedoms to the shadows. the only reason to proactively *deny* a society freedom of religion would be to scale back other freedoms of expression on the grounds that they are not intended to go as far as the right to publish *religious tracts*, or the right to associate for *religious rituals*...",cpud2ds,1520.779891358628,1,1427624933,76,11,68359,0,37.7842105263158,456.0,733.0,14.0,23,0.07142857142857142,0.0,0.35714285714285715,0.6428571428571429,0.0,0.0,0.07142857142857142,0.14285714285714285,0.07142857142857142,0.0,0.0,0.14285714285714285,0.14285714285714285,0.0,1.6428571428571428,0.20814651035239268,0.23026315789473684,0.0,0,0.0,458,86.22,53.49,19.96,98.09,35.23,28.38,89.08,55.24,9.83,3.28,0.22,1.31,1.53,0.00,0.22,6.55,10.04,15.94,7.42,4.80,6.77,2.40,11.57,3.93,2.18,1.97,1.53,1.09,8.08,6.77,1.31,0.22,0.22,0.66,7.21,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,15.94,2.62,2.62,2.18,3.71,2.18,6.55,3.49,0.44,1.75,0.87,1.75,0.22,0.44,0.00,1.09,6.55,1.97,0.87,3.71,0.22,0.22,0.87,9.83,0.87,8.73,0.44,6.33,2.18,1.97,1.53,0.00,0.66,3.71,0.44,0.44,0.00,0.00,0.22,0.22,0.00,17.90,3.49,5.24,0.44,0.66,0.87,0.00,1.09,0.87,0.44,0.00,4.80
t3_335312,"let me give you every reason that kanye west is nothing but an undeserved scapegoat, who had provided nothing but top-tier music since his debut. let me school you with some straight facts: kanye, despite his publicity stunts, is regarded by many as a kind, compassionate individual. he often talks to his fans, and from all accounts is genuinely interested in what they have to say, what their life is like, and what their goals are. this is somebody who for the past nine years has been public enemy number one. it would be easy for him to go into absolute seclusion, and bitterly resent everybody, but he doesn't. he has a passion behind what he does, and it reflects in his music. rick rubin regards kanye as the most influential and groundbreaking artist in hip-hop at the moment. paul mccartney regards kanye as a genius. he invited seth rogen and james franco to perform their ""bound 3"" parody at his wedding. he has won the love and respect of anybody who genuinely takes an interest in his music (which has won 21 grammy awards, might i add). despite the vma incident, kanye and taylor swift are good friends, and swift herself has a deep respect for kanye as an artist. not to mention, the dude has not had it easy. he slaved for years as a producer before finally making his big break on the production for jay-z's blueprint, with beats for it would not no love (heart of the city) and i.z.z.o (takeover). despite his success as a producer, everybody told him he could not rap, and would never make it. he eventually dropped college dropout in 2004, reinventing the game with an album full of incredible soul-beats at a time where everybody was still trying to copy the g-funk west coast vibe dr. dre's 2001 had left. the album had smash hits like through the wire, where he rapped about his near-death experience in a car crash while still wearing his reconstructive mouthgear; or his club-hit about jesus in jesus walks, at a time where you weren't going to get anything religious on the radio unless you are on country/gospel station in the south. late registration debuted 2005, with a completely fresh soul sound, and featuring the talents of adam levine (maroon 5), nas, jay-z, and of course jamie foxx in his smash hit ""gold digger"". i do not care who you are, this song had everybody dancing and was played and still is played in every club from new york to tokyo to berlin. his other single ""diamonds from sierra lione"" touched on the issues of blood diamonds and the exploitation of africans by africans ""over here, its the drug trade - we die from drugs/ over there, they die from what we buy from drugs"". this album also has one of his most heart-felt songs kanye has produced to date: ""hey mama"", his tribute to his mother donda west, who raised him as single black mother in chicago, with all the trials and tribulations that brought. the song is a beautiful display of a man who has a deepfound respect for the one who gave him everything. ""i was three years old when you and i moved to the chi/ late december, harsh winter gave me a cold/ you fixed me up something that was good for my soul/ famous homemade chicken soup, can i have another bowl?/ you worked late nights just to keep on the lights/ momma got the training wheels so i could keep on my bike/ ... and it do not got to be mother's day/ or your birthday for me to just call and say: 'mama!' i want to scream so loud for you/ cause i am so proud of you."" 2007 kanye released graduation. this was a completely new sound to his previous soulful works. this had a heavy techno/edm inspiration, from artists such as daft punk, in addition to the influence of house music with its chi-town origins. his hit song ""stronger"", sampling the also famous daft punk song ""harder, better, faster"" was played once again world-wide in every club from l.a. to london to sydney. it was groundbreaking, as kanye melded genres that nobody had been able to meld. he gave popularity to the robotic voice trope that many artists copy to this day, and re-purposed auto-tune. it was no longer for untalented hacks who could not sing: it was for artists who wanted to give a specific feel to their music. then by 2008, things really started going south for kanye. his mother passed away due to complications with a cosmetic surgical operation, his relationship with his girlfriend was deteriorating, and he had a hatred of himself. it was in this despair and desperation that he produced his darkest work, ""808s and heartbreaks"", which is essentially his thesis on pop music, providing us with an incredible set of pop beats, all of which were phenomenal, and embracing the cold, detached robot voice that he had popularized as a way of reflecting the depression and lack of joy and humanity he possessed. the album provided him an avenue to channel the dark times he was going through. the track ""coldest winter"" is directly about the passing of his mother, donda ""it's 4am and i can't sleep/ her love is all that i can see/ memories made in the coldest winter/ goodbye my friend, will i ever love again/ if spring can take the snow away, can it wash away all our mistakes?/ memories made in the coldest winter/ goodbye my friend, i will not ever love again"" then, in 2010 kanye releases his magnum opus, ""my beautiful dark twisted fantasy"". critically acclaimed and regarded by many as the greatest rap album of all time, this album blew everybody out of the water, with not a single bad track. it received the near impossible 10/10 rating by pitchfork, putting it in the same league as ""sgt. pepper's lonely hearts club band"" and ""abbey road"" by the beatles, ""london calling"" by the clash, and ""animals"" by pink floyd. it was deeply self-reflexive, and in most senses a powerful declaration that he was not defeated, that he is in fact at the top of his game and that nothing can stop yeezy season approaching. his song ""power"" is nothing short of an inspiring, uplifting, empowering composition which firmly asserts that kanye is back, and he does not give a flying fuck. ""screams from the haters got a nice ring to it/ i guess every superhero need his theme music"". his other single ""all of the lights"" has a whopping fifteen extra artists, including rihanna, elton john, fergie, kid cudi and many others. i could write a whole essay on runaway, or blame game then, in 2013 kanye released ""yeezus"", a.k.a. absolute genius. it is his anti-hiphop album of harsh, grinding samples, and disjointed jarring beats that comes together and by no sense of reason create some beautifully profound music. he denounces the institutional racism of the dea and the cca in his controversial track ""new slaves"". he mocks the hubris and egocentrism that everybody sees him as having in his track i am a god, which takes the absolute piss out of the modern man who considers himself a god, with the absurd line ""i am a god/ so hurry up with my damn croissants!"" kanye has stopped caring what people think about him a long time ago. but that's not what makes the album absolute genius. it is the fact that the entire album is in fact an allegory depicting the tragic fall of the ""yeezus"" persona, going from absolute stardom and egotism with the strong, hard hitting, angry, egotistical tracks on sight, black skinhead, i am a god, and new slaves. now i have been writing this comment for the past hour, so i will not even go into his non-musical exploits, but rest assured that as far as fashion goes, kanye west is leading the forefront with his red octobers or yeezy boost sneakers with a resale value of several thousand dollars each. now, i hope that if you actually took the time to read at least half of this, you will see that the hatred for kanye is little more than an attempt to marginalize one of the greatest artists of our time. his outbursts, though not classy, are not unfounded. heck, john lennon literally said the beatles were bigger than jesus; if that's not hubris i do not know what is. both lennon and west are icons and artists who have changed this world forever. just because you have not taken the time to see further than your limited frame-of-reference by no means makes kanye a bad artist or a bad human being. he is god sent, and full to the brim of musical talent. his new album will undoubtedly bring another wave of incredible artistry.",cqhqb8z,685.8534022478536,1,1429476471,520,50,-15445,0,61.16986046557237,1478.0,2165.0,69.0,1,0.08695652173913043,0.0,0.15942028985507245,0.10144927536231885,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028985507246376812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.057971014492753624,0.014492753623188406,0.4492753623188406,NaN,0.29161028416779433,0.0,0,0.0,1517,73.75,70.34,10.62,47.73,25.28,16.68,83.26,50.63,14.57,8.44,2.18,0.33,0.99,4.55,0.40,6.13,7.38,13.32,7.12,2.83,5.74,2.04,12.59,5.60,2.77,1.85,1.71,2.44,5.01,3.10,1.91,0.07,0.79,0.33,11.54,0.53,0.40,0.59,4.55,10.35,1.38,1.45,1.12,1.52,2.77,3.03,4.42,1.19,2.11,0.86,1.58,0.59,0.40,0.13,0.13,6.53,1.78,1.38,2.44,1.25,0.40,4.15,7.32,1.05,12.59,1.85,6.20,4.68,1.78,3.03,0.07,0.26,0.86,0.20,0.59,0.26,0.13,0.07,0.00,0.00,18.06,4.42,6.06,0.26,0.13,0.13,0.13,1.25,3.03,0.79,0.53,1.32

t3_2x854p,"i would love to respond to your question! i think you chose some great songs to analyze, particularly songs that sort of bookmark kanye's career for me (until his next album comes out). like a few people have already mentioned, ""all falls down"" was one of the cornerstones of the revival of mainstream self-conscious, self-analytical hip hop. while there were definitely other artists making great music like common, mos def, dead prez, etc. who are considered more lyrical and potentially more artistic, kanye seemed to re-infuse mainstream hip hop with a sense of purpose beyond promoting one's lifestyle, gang affiliations, drug dealing, etc. and again, the lyrics for ""all falls down"" touch on ideas and sentiments that were not only contrary to what the usual sentiment was for mainstream artists, but a sentiment that kanye believes (and perhaps rightly so) pervades black culture- the unhealthy obsession with materialism. in each verse, kanye shows how damaging this obsession is, from the woman naming her daughter alexis or a lexus (""she could not afford a car/so she named her daughter alexis""), to ""it seems we livin' the american dream/but the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem/the prettiest people do the ugliest things/for the road to riches and diamond rings"" (both an indictment of celebrity culture, and the people who emulate it), and ""we buy our way out of jail but we can't buy freedom/we buy a lot of clothes though we do not really need 'em/things to cover up what is inside/cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth"" another assessment of culture and kanye's experience as a black person in america (really most people's experience) of being repeatedly told by the media that we should aspire to become more thin, wear better clothes, etc. instead of work on our inner selves. ""get em high"" is an interesting example because i can see how you would construe that as being somewhat one dimensional. but the song is performed by kanye, common, and talib kwali, two rappers who until that point in their careers (and are arguably still) some of the most lyrical and culturally conscious rappers today. so the irony here is that kanye would employ two rappers who are more known for thought provoking discussions on black culture for a song that would have been more mainstream for that moment in time. basically, it is like having bob dylan sing a song meant for the club. ""church in the wild"" is an interesting choice. i love the chorus and i think frank ocean's contribution to the whole watch the throne project was great. the title itself invokes a sense of wild lawlessness, which is supported by the religious references in the hook and the cultures both jay z and kanye address ""i'm out here ballin/i know y'all hear my sneaks"" after three or four references to greek/roman philosophers, perhaps an attempt to juxtapose high-minded society with urban street culture, and ""we formed a new religion/no sins as long as there is permission... it is something that the preacher can't preach"". this all seems to be kanye's attempt to show how the old religions weren't working and his new world is adapted to the kind of lawlessness we see (or are presented) today- room for sins of excess like drugs, sex, etc. on a side note, this song sets up the extravagance and maximalism of the entire watch the throne album by calling into question the most established paradigms in our culture. finally, ""blood on the leaves"" is an incredibly powerful song, not only because of the classic nina simone sample from ""strange fruit"", a song about black people being hanged due to racism in the south, but also because of kanye's attempt to highlight racism that still pervades american culture. ""all i want is what i can't buy now"" addresses kanye's feelings that even though he is rich and influential, he is still very much a slave to culture and society (it could also be a call back to ""all falls down"" ""we buy our way out of jail but we can't buy freedom""). the entire fourth verse could be a darker repurposing of the ideas in ""all falls down"" where he laments all the struggles he still endures as a black man today despite his success like constantly being told no when he wants to buys lavish things like benzes, cocaine, etc. (symbolic for success in hip hop), the desire that is perpetuated towards women to get support from successful rappers or athletes, and the parallel between the two. there's more to all of this but i am going to be late to work. if you have any questions or comments, i would be happy to discuss them with you! hope this is helpful in someway, if only for contributing to the discussion. also, apologies if there are any weird typos in this.",coxwtm2,490.92674098558007,1,1424968178,340,29,15146,0,49.0127036199095,816.0,1215.0,26.0,7,0.15384615384615385,0.0,0.5384615384615384,0.46153846153846156,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.11538461538461539,0.038461538461538464,1.4230769230769234,0.02956979381327207,0.29044117647058826,0.0,0,0.0,830,78.11,74.25,21.50,55.29,31.92,19.76,84.70,50.60,10.72,6.02,1.57,1.81,0.72,1.45,0.48,4.70,7.83,14.10,6.99,5.42,7.11,1.33,10.84,5.42,3.25,1.57,0.96,3.98,4.46,3.01,1.45,0.36,0.36,0.12,10.60,0.24,0.12,0.96,1.08,13.25,3.25,1.33,2.05,3.61,1.45,3.73,3.86,1.45,1.57,0.24,1.81,0.84,0.36,0.12,0.12,7.83,2.77,1.33,3.01,1.45,0.00,1.93,8.43,0.48,11.20,1.33,6.39,3.37,2.05,2.17,0.24,1.20,0.96,0.24,0.24,0.00,0.24,0.00,0.00,0.00,18.31,3.13,4.94,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.24,0.84,3.61,2.17,2.17,1.20

t3_3fvhjh,"overall i agree with your point. i think it is largely detrimental to overall safety. but as a counter argument: let's assume you can either argue for a person carrying pepper spray or against. let us disregard the rationale for why you would argue for either for the moment. now consider a scenario where a person is faced with a choice between walking home at night through a not so nice neighborhood or taking a cab home. if the person feels safe enough, they will walk to avoid paying the cab, else they will pay and take the cab. if the person is carrying pepper spray, they will feel safer. let us assume that they feel safe enough to walk home if they are carrying pepper spray, but not safe enough to walk home if they are not carrying pepper spray. so now we have three scenarios. ranked from most risky to least risky they are: walk home without pepper spray, walk home with pepper spray, and cab home. if you do not have pepper spray, then you cannot walk home with pepper spray (obviously) and vice versa. so depending on your initial choice of advocating or not advocating for pepper spray, your options are limited from three to two scenarios. from here i feel like you get where i am going with it and to not belabor the point anymore: if you advocate for no pepper spray then a person who accepts you advice is more likely to take a cab, which is safer than walking with pepper spray. therefore, if we put aside reasons for arguing for or against victim protection, it is possible that arguing against victims protecting themselves produces a safer outcome.",ctsc6ss,237.21782381459974,1,1438789391,391,14,3814,0,66.00349650349654,286.0,406.0,14.0,2,0.21428571428571427,0.07142857142857142,0.14285714285714285,0.35714285714285715,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14285714285714285,0.0,0.9285714285714286,0.22545787545787543,0.17482517482517482,0.0,0,0.0,286,63.32,63.68,65.72,25.77,20.43,16.43,84.62,51.40,12.24,9.44,1.40,1.75,3.50,0.00,2.80,2.80,5.94,12.94,7.69,3.50,8.04,3.15,15.03,4.90,3.85,1.75,1.05,1.75,6.99,3.50,3.50,1.05,1.75,0.00,12.59,0.00,0.35,0.00,0.00,18.88,4.55,2.45,2.80,6.99,0.35,9.79,1.40,0.00,0.00,1.40,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,9.09,2.10,0.70,0.70,1.40,4.20,0.35,11.89,2.10,10.49,4.90,2.80,2.80,1.05,0.00,3.15,0.70,0.00,0.00,0.35,0.00,0.00,0.35,0.00,0.00,10.84,4.90,3.85,1.05,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.35,0.70,0.00

t3_3fvhjh,"i have done a lot of advocacy work with rape victims over the years, as well as am one myself, and let me tell you - none of those things would have prevented the rapes i have been told about over the years. the vast majority of rapes occur in the home of the victim or the rapist, and the rapist is someone that the victim knows and trusts. here is the sad truth - if you are a woman, statistically, you are more likely to be raped by your dad than a stranger in the bushes. if you really want to prevent rape, you need to focus on the vast majority of rapes. so that to me would mean things like bystander intervention, where you emphasize the need for bystanders to step in and seperate someone from a situation they think could be inappropriate, teaching about rape and sexual violence during sex ed so people grow up understanding what the signs of an abusive relationship looks like and how to get out. also so that people learn that sexual violence is not the victims fault and what steps to take if they want to report to the police. so many people are afriad to come forward and the recidivism rate for sex crimes is so high it is this horrible cycle of serial rapists who do not ever get punished and people keep getting victimized. also there needs to be more education on consent, not only to teach what consent is, but to help empower young girl to feel comfortable saying no and that they do not have to do anything sexually that they do not want to. a lot of us get the message that we should just go along with whatever the guy wants even if we do not want that, which opens us up to predators who take advantage of that situation. anyways, my point is there are a lot of more effective things we could be doing besides telling people to be afriad of the dark, which people naturally are anyways btw.",ctse486,202.55081951750955,1,1438792399,391,14,6822,0,55.33923913043479,345.0,475.0,10.0,5,0.4,0.0,0.1,0.7,0.0,0.0,0.1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.3,0.08526440879382056,0.2144927536231884,0.0,0,0.0,345,60.40,73.82,4.36,1.00,34.50,14.20,92.46,60.87,13.91,6.38,1.74,1.45,2.03,0.00,1.16,7.54,7.83,15.94,10.43,6.38,7.54,2.32,19.13,4.06,2.32,2.90,0.29,2.90,7.83,1.45,6.38,0.29,3.48,0.29,11.01,0.29,0.29,0.58,0.58,13.04,2.03,0.58,5.22,3.48,0.58,4.06,1.16,0.58,0.29,0.29,4.35,0.00,0.00,4.35,0.00,10.43,2.32,0.58,4.93,2.03,1.16,0.87,15.65,0.29,8.12,1.74,4.93,2.03,2.03,0.00,0.29,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.16,0.00,0.29,0.00,0.29,0.58,7.25,2.90,3.77,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.58,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00

t3_3dhvig,"my initial reaction to this was outright confusion, as both i, my wife, and most people i know have friends of the opposite gender and those relationships do not fit the conditions you have posited. however, simply saying that does not warrant much of an argument, does it? then again, *your* conviction is based on exactly that same thing. quite simply, you are taking your own limited, personal experience and using it to reach a conclusion about the rest of the world. anecdote should not be much basis for such sweeping conclusions, but unfortunately, that's how most people tend to think. so, if your conviction on this subject comes from the experience of one person, does my own experience, as one person, negate that? if we are being logical, it should. i suppose you could say that i am lying, or that i am simply too naive to see that my relationships truly *do* fit into your characterization. however, those issues of veracity are frankly the only things that could logically diminish my account in the overall formulation of your conclusions here. furthermore, you have already admitted to having had a purely platonic male friend in the past. so, you know it is a possibility. however, you dismiss this as being an anomaly. actually, after telling a story in which you confirm that these relationships *are* possible, you then immediately start to deny its significance by saying, ""i think it may be possible"". why, after you have already shown with an example that it in fact *is* possible, do you immediately introduce doubt by saying that it ""may"" be possible? surely, you have already confirmed that it *is* possible. so, now your only remaining issue is one of frequency. from your own experience, the vast majority of these relationships do not work. in this thread, you have many people telling you from *their* own experience that many actually do. so, perhaps your issues of frequency are more unique to you than you think. let's look at your anomaly: you wrote, "" i always included my boyfriend and introduced them, and they became friends even..."" about the possibility of hooking up you wrote, ""but i would respect my relationship enough that i am not really interested in doing that anyway"". so, if we demonstrate mutual trust by introducing our significant others to our different-gendered friends, and we respect our significant others enough to ensure we would never do something to hurt them, it seems to help. it is at least a very good start, right? you also wrote, ""i also have zero sexual attraction for him and imagine this is the same with him, towards me. i'd say that certainly helps as well! i am assuming there are plenty of men in the world that you do not find sexually attractive, but also like their personalities. i am also assuming that there are plenty of men out there who would feel the same about you. and, contrary to popular belief, even if you are a very attractive woman, not every man on earth is going to want to sleep with you. that being said, while a lack of sexual attraction helps, i do not think it is necessary at all. i think what is most necessary is trust and respect. the bottom line is, you know it can work. you can even point to specific things that seem to make it work. those specific things you pointed to really are not anomalous! it sounds like your experience has been limited and you are not forming the right kinds of male-female relationships. i'd like to add this as a more in-depth counter-anecdote: i have a few attractive female friends that are not my wife. they are intelligent, kind, interesting, and fun people who *happen* to be good-looking women. they are simply people who i enjoy spending time with. in a couple of instances, they are people that my wife has introduced me to. friends of her own, who i have grown close to. my wife works crazy hours, and i have gone out with them alone for meals, movies, concerts, etc. i have felt none of these characteristics you are talking about. it is not an ego boost, and i have no ""just in case"" thinking. that last part was the most bizarre to me. the idea of losing my wife is far too devastating to start considering ""backup plans"". in terms of the ego boost, i am not sure what you mean exactly. i mean, i am certain that my female friends are not hanging out with me because i look like brad pritt...primarily because i don't. and i am not walking around with my chest puffed because of the ""hot chick"" that's by my side. we are hanging out because we think one another's an interesting, fun enough person to hang out with. that may give an ego boost, but just as much as a same-gendered friend would. we are being validated as people. another human enjoys our company. of course it feels nice. it needn't be about sex! anyways, i hope that with all the responses in this thread, at least someone will change your mind. because, if not, you will be losing nearly 50% of the population from your pool of potential friends! friends are wonderful things, and they are not terribly easy to make and keep. do not limit the possibilities.",ct5cmrc,1668.9838226159188,1,1437059565,106,45,7578,0,66.9637472283814,902.0,1323.0,58.0,2,0.10344827586206896,0.0,0.1206896551724138,0.15517241379310345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05172413793103448,0.0,0.43103448275862066,0.03951545530492899,0.19401330376940132,0.0,0,0.0,910,24.37,80.42,36.31,67.32,15.96,17.91,91.43,60.66,20.66,12.42,5.16,1.32,4.51,0.33,1.10,8.24,4.29,12.75,11.43,6.48,6.04,2.64,18.68,5.60,3.30,0.99,0.66,2.97,4.73,3.41,1.21,0.11,0.22,0.55,15.05,0.55,1.21,1.32,0.88,15.71,3.41,1.65,1.87,3.96,2.09,4.51,2.53,0.44,0.88,0.55,0.77,0.22,0.00,0.44,0.11,7.14,4.07,1.21,1.10,0.44,0.66,1.98,14.07,1.21,8.02,0.77,4.73,2.53,0.99,0.77,0.11,0.22,0.11,0.00,0.33,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.11,0.22,19.01,5.93,7.14,0.22,0.00,0.44,0.44,0.66,1.65,0.88,0.00,1.65

t3_3ewva7,"ghibli films convey a feeling of sublime **wonder** unlike any other art or medium i have ever experienced. a large part of this is exploring the connection between humans and the environment/the world around them through the plot, themes and motifs, and *gorgeous* art. in *spirited away* this is largely by incorporating spectacularly creative and colorful elements of japanese shinto mythology and fantastic scenes and characters. the landscapes and settings portrayed include a touch of steampunk, ""the bizarre"" reminiscent of lewis carroll and alice in wonderland, and scenes of intense tranquility. as the film follows chihiro, we get to see some of the most brilliant scenes of both traveling and growing up. *princess mononoke* also presents the shinto religious motifs and mixes them with the conflict of modernization and human industry/technology/feudalism - portraying environmental themes with a fantasy flair. the incredible strength of character displayed by ashitaka, eboshi, and san help carry this film, there is wonder and marvel at their badassness. ashitaka is a beast. *nausicaa of the valley of the wind* was an early pioneer of the apocalyptic wasteland setting. i hate bugs, but the way that the film portrayed the bugs in the movie was so endearing, startlingly innocent, and compassionate it is the only thing that has ever made me feel strongly emotional about bugs. it paints a bleak and haunting beautiful picture about war and devastation and survival in a wasteland all at the same time. *kiki's delivery service* is another slice of life with picturesque scenes and a touch of magic/witchcraft. the sense of wonder comes via scenes of flight whether by broom, dirigible, bird, or a ill-conceived propeller bike - flying over the charming scenes of urban life while following kiki's journey of growing up in a new city. in *my neighbor totoro*, the wonder is strongly tied to slice of life and compelling family themes. the young children encountering totoro and the catbus as part of moving to their new home and how the fantastic adventure is interweaved with the real struggles of growing up, being raised by one parent while the other deals with illness, and sisterhood. studio ghibli films are breathtakingly gorgeous, crafted for appreciation by children and adults, incorporate serious and meaningful themes, expertly portray the bildungsroman/coming-of-age story/character growth for both male and female protagonists alike, and conduct a sense of wonder in a way that no other piece of art or literature is able to do.",ctj8djb,223.68785317153564,1,1438109674,35,10,6424,0,36.46755233990149,406.0,694.0,16.0,85,0.0625,0.0,0.0625,0.125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1875,0.0,0.4375,0.04285195559705364,0.3768472906403941,0.0,0,0.0,415,96.18,57.65,37.17,62.33,25.94,27.23,77.59,44.82,5.30,2.17,0.96,0.24,0.00,0.00,0.96,3.13,10.12,15.42,3.86,2.41,9.40,0.24,8.92,5.30,1.20,0.48,0.24,2.41,6.27,4.10,2.17,0.48,0.72,0.24,5.30,0.72,0.24,0.96,0.24,7.47,2.89,0.96,0.00,2.65,0.72,2.17,3.13,1.45,0.00,0.96,1.45,0.24,1.20,0.00,0.00,6.27,1.69,0.72,3.61,0.48,0.00,0.72,6.27,0.24,13.01,3.86,6.75,2.41,1.20,3.13,1.20,0.00,0.48,0.24,0.24,0.24,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,16.39,3.86,5.06,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.20,0.48,0.48,0.00,5.30
t3_32dzr6,"the simple answer, is that at least in the united states, with very few exceptions people are ""at will"" employees. meaning that if you are not up to the task, a company can just fire you. what this means is that it is much more efficient for an impersonal hr person to interview you for two reasons. 1.) it adds something to their job, and once you are big enough to have an hr department you can't hope to be functional without one, so you may as well utilize your investment in it. 2.) it takes time away from a person's ability to work, if they have to do interviews repeatedly. you have to consider that, on average you can't just interview a single person and call it good. you have to entertain multiple applicants, which means that over the course of a week you might pull 15 or more hours of research and development time away from a project so you can hire one person. that's assuming the situation is as cut and dry as i have stated. a lot of the time that is not the case.",cqabzcm,117.56821351018932,1,1428889550,29,16,804,0,75.05291788856307,186.0,252.0,11.0,5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09090909090909091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09090909090909091,0.0,0.0,0.18181818181818182,0.03214285714285714,0.2956989247311828,0.0,0,0.0,189,62.94,87.78,24.87,45.20,17.18,15.34,93.65,59.79,16.40,7.94,0.53,0.00,6.35,0.00,1.06,8.47,7.94,15.87,11.11,3.17,6.35,2.65,13.23,6.35,3.17,1.06,4.23,5.29,3.17,2.12,1.06,0.00,0.00,0.00,13.23,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,11.11,3.70,0.53,1.59,4.76,0.00,4.76,1.06,0.00,0.00,1.06,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,5.29,0.00,1.59,2.12,1.59,0.00,0.00,14.29,2.12,9.52,0.53,5.29,3.70,8.99,0.53,0.00,0.53,0.00,0.00,0.53,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.53,0.00,14.29,5.82,4.23,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.06,2.12,1.06,0.00

t3_3b60s8,"the totino's little party pizzas are wonderful. they are admittedly horrible, but they are also wonderfully horrible. it is like a train wreck in your mouth. little ceasars is also far from the worst pizza you can find from a pizzeria. i stumbled into a place in chicago that appeared to have not known the difference between salt and sugar when making their sauce. side note from another place: if you are going to put out garlic salt instead of garlic powder... warn us. little ceasars, dominoes, pizza hut etc. are all mediocre pizza places. most chains are. but there are definitely some places that long to serve pizza, really longing to have a pizza because they have only heard of them by rough description. for frozen if you look at the jacks/ tombstone/ red baron types... these are absolutely what you are talking about. light on the cheese, heavy on the lack of taste. these also sell for about $3 a pie. the cost of a slice at a good place. but you want to move up in quality. so you think di'giorno or freschetta.. but these are made by the same companies as the shitty ones listed above with the same idea... which is to make pizza really cheap. most pizza toppings also do not survive freezing very well. which is why there is a lot of compromise in quality. however if you are in a store that puts a lot of effort and branding into their store brand (wegmans in the northeast comes to mind)... their frozen pizza, and all of their store branded items are made to re-enforce the brand of the store. which is why their name is all over the packaging instead of having an ""exclusive brand"" like ""everyday essentials"". those are going to be the frozen pizzas that have the best chance of not just being a decent frozen meal, but also being a decent pizza. different from a pizzeria but just as good on a quality scale. (the aforementioned wegmans pizzas always struck me as a little floury and not as greasy as the closest pizzerias to me growing up. but very close to one of the upscale pizzerias i found on chicago's michigan avenue) you might want to also look into picking up a frozen pizza (mailed directly to you) from chicagos ""giordanos"". it is as close as i have come to getting good pizzeria quality pizza from frozen. also about the same cost as getting it in the store. you're not going to get a nyc pizzeria quality pie from frozen though. the hand tossed dough etc. just is not replicable in the large scale assembly line demanded by frozen. but then again.. you are not going to get that nyc quality in most of the country from a pizzeria anyway.",csj6qcn,653.8876266763774,1,1435306684,50,23,1931,0,72.98361111111112,470.0,670.0,36.0,9,0.2222222222222222,0.0,0.3055555555555556,0.1388888888888889,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027777777777777776,0.0,0.6944444444444445,0.05979591836734694,0.2425531914893617,0.0,0,0.0,473,82.53,50.85,38.44,45.17,13.14,15.22,84.57,54.55,9.51,5.71,1.06,0.21,2.54,0.00,1.90,3.81,9.09,16.91,7.61,6.98,7.82,1.48,14.59,5.71,4.44,1.48,0.42,2.11,3.59,2.33,1.27,0.42,0.21,0.21,5.92,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,12.68,1.06,1.69,1.27,2.75,1.69,5.71,4.86,1.06,0.21,2.54,5.50,0.63,0.00,0.00,4.86,5.29,0.63,0.85,1.90,1.69,0.63,1.69,9.94,1.27,12.68,2.33,9.30,1.06,0.42,0.21,0.00,1.90,0.00,0.00,0.85,0.21,0.00,0.21,0.21,0.21,15.64,9.73,1.48,0.21,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.21,1.27,0.85,1.27,0.63

(this primacy of how we treat ourselves is implied by the gold and silver rules, but not the platinum). the core of morality is that the individual has the capacity to choose, and all choices have different consequences that one choice is better and of greater value than another. to deliberately choose a greater value over the lesser is the core of morality, and to choose the bad over the good is the core of immorality. the gold and silver rules are only as good as this more fundamental aspect of morality, how you treat yourself. even robinson crusoe, alone on an island, has choices to make that make him either a virtuous man who works hard and struggles to do the right things to survive, or an immoral man who ignores his circumstances and chooses to laze on the beach wishing vainly for the coconuts to fall. there are thousands of virtues (and vices) that have nothing to do with others, but that require a sustained effort of moral/righteous choices to attain *such as*: self-honesty, integrity, clarity of mind, industry, productiveness, rationality, creativity, focus/concentration, imagination, pride, courage, determination, knowing when to reward/punish yourself, knowing when to push on or rest etc etc! the golden and silver rules are only as useful to society as the virtues you have yourself!

t3_3gf00z,"your original point talked about how the subreddits you mentioned were attacking the extremist views of the perspective they were attacking, and this led to an uninformed audience being created. while i agree with you that there are much better ways to fix the problems that these subreddits try to inform you about, (for example, personally i believe one major step that can be taken to combat racial inequality and racism is to put more funding into education and working on income equality), it is a far stretch to say that they are actually *hurting* their respective movements. i am not so familiar with the views of those particular subreddits, so i cannot attest to if they mostly just attack the extremist counterarguments (or whether or not they are actually just circlejerks). however, i would argue that even in their purported forms, subreddits like those do more good than harm. raising awareness about any specific problem is a difficult yet crucial first step about any social injustice. despite them possibly not raising awareness for the most effective method of combating the problem, the fact remains that the issue's notoriety gains prevelance through internet sharing. you might even argue that with today's prevailing trends that people have attention spans which are shrinking daily, educating everyone to the greatest extent may not be possible. in order to combat this, material that is generated to garner support for the cause will have to be truncated in size in order to still have its message gotten across in a smaller amount of time. if someone reads about a mild (but incredibly common) injustice towards transwomen, they may not deem the issue worth their attention (especially because this would be an isolated article that they are observing). if they find a particularly convincing, yet long, article, they may also decide the issue is not worth their time. although we would all be better off if everyone was more well-informed and educated on all topics, the fact is that society really does not work that way (and maybe it is for the better, because many people also have to deal with the stresses of their own day-to-day lives). ultimately, these subreddits create a very condensed form of revelation for the public at large, which is very effective at drumming up awareness, and for those who actually want to go and change these problems, they will probably read up more on it to better understand the problem anyway. so, in conclusion: **the subreddits may not have the most important message to give, but they are an invaluable means of spreading said message to a public that might otherwise remain uninformed.**",ctxjwbr,263.25758127218137,1,1439178448,45,6,2044,0,36.27581698211495,443.0,712.0,13.0,3,0.15384615384615385,0.07692307692307693,0.46153846153846156,0.23076923076923078,0.0,0.15384615384615385,0.0,0.15384615384615385,0.0,0.07692307692307693,0.0,0.07692307692307693,0.15384615384615385,0.07692307692307693,1.6153846153846152,0.08347631900263479,0.26410835214446954,0.0,0,0.0,446,56.00,57.13,35.89,22.30,34.31,24.89,85.20,56.73,13.23,6.05,1.12,0.22,1.12,0.00,3.59,7.17,6.95,13.68,9.87,7.62,6.28,2.02,15.02,5.38,3.59,1.12,0.45,3.36,6.50,3.14,3.36,0.22,1.12,0.45,10.09,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,20.40,4.04,2.47,2.91,5.16,2.02,6.50,1.12,0.45,0.45,0.22,0.22,0.00,0.22,0.00,0.00,8.52,1.35,2.47,2.69,1.79,1.35,2.24,9.87,1.79,10.09,1.57,5.38,2.47,1.12,0.22,0.00,0.90,0.00,0.00,0.67,0.00,0.00,0.22,0.22,0.22,12.78,2.91,4.93,0.22,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.67,0.00,0.45,2.24,1.35
t3_3bdv00,"the presence of present suffering does not equal future suffering. **be happy.** the complicated part is how to achieve this. the first thing one must do, is to figure out why they are here. in the grand scheme of things, what does their life mean? one needs to find some type of spirituality. for those who believe in a deity it may not be as difficult, but for those who do not, a void is often left. the first place to start for an atheist is to recognize the sheer improbability of one?s own consciousness. the fact that billions of years ago energy condensed into matter, this matter consolidated to form giant space rocks, these rocks flew past each other altering each other?s trajectory through space, one just happened to settle next to an appropriate size star and at the appropriate distance, amino acids on this rock came together in the perfect conditions, created life, life evolved, and you became you. not only is it amazing that you are here. the fact that you know you are here is amazing. i think therefore i am. (i refine descartes? statement as, ?i am aware, therefore i am.?) knowing how all this happened, and realizing the time scale, one can start to appreciate the gift of the short time of consciousness we are all given by the cosmos. we only have a short time in existence so it is important to attain this happiness while we are here, this appreciation of our consciousness is the first step. many people subconsciously know they want happiness, but are confused as to how to get there. i find it unsettling when i hear people worry about growing up to be a janitor or some other career that is unjustly looked down upon by society. don?t get me wrong, a person needs money to be happy, but the only reason they need it is to fulfill maslow?s basic needs. all other acquirements are superfluous. what people don?t study enough is what creates happiness, they only study what creates money. what we must realize is that we are the human animal. when is a dog at its happiest? is it happy when it is in a cage, cooped up, with no stimulation? or is it happiest when it is running around, playing fetch? a dog is happiest when it is being a dog and doing dog things. the same goes for humans. humans are happiest when they are actualizing their human nature. when we notice the presence of mirror neurons, and the negative feelings that arise in ourselves when we hurt someone, and notice the positive feelings that arise when we help someone, we can start to understand our true nature. often when people come home from war, after having killed, after destroying other consciousness?s, they become suicidal or depressed. conversely, new mothers and fathers often describe the day their child was born, the day they created consciousness, as ?the happiest day of my life.? these are actions humans take that are at two ends of a spectrum, with many other actions that affect other people in between. insulting someone and complimenting someone are also two opposite actions on this spectrum. when i ask myself why i want to have children i cannot come up with an obvious rational answer, but when i notice that procreating is ingrained in the human species and life itself, the answer becomes clear. i want to have children because i am human, and that?s what humans do. humans become happy when they are moral beings because it is especially in our nature. we are more conscious than most species because of our social nature. our higher level thinking has arisen, through evolution, specifically as a result of our need to navigate social intricacies. we are fundamentally connected with each other and when we act like it we reap personal internal rewards.",csld97c,271.6880924161819,1,1435525617,110,48,18977,0,64.13500404858303,650.0,963.0,38.0,1,0.02631578947368421,0.07894736842105263,0.13157894736842105,0.3157894736842105,0.0,0.02631578947368421,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02631578947368421,0.05263157894736842,0.0,0.7105263157894737,NaN,0.24615384615384617,0.0,0,0.0,657,42.11,79.02,63.92,71.49,17.76,18.87,88.89,55.10,16.89,7.91,2.44,3.04,0.76,0.00,1.67,8.98,6.09,11.87,10.20,6.09,7.00,1.07,18.26,6.39,2.89,4.11,1.67,2.13,6.54,4.41,1.98,0.46,0.61,0.61,11.11,0.30,0.00,0.15,0.15,17.20,5.78,2.89,1.52,2.44,2.28,3.35,1.22,0.30,0.15,0.46,0.91,0.15,0.76,0.00,0.00,8.68,3.96,1.98,1.83,1.37,0.30,2.13,14.46,0.30,13.09,1.67,5.18,6.24,0.61,0.76,0.15,0.30,0.30,0.46,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,12.48,5.18,5.78,0.00,0.00,0.61,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.30,0.61

t3_3dsku2,"here is my very simplified version of progressive vs conservative philosophy: progressive-things are awful, we need to do everything we can to fix them! conservative-don't make things worse trying to fix it! republicans do not have a desire to see people downtrodden and suffering. they do not want people to be poor, homeless, and dying from lack of medial care. they simply do not trust that the government stepping in to fix some people's problems will not make the situation worse for everyone. health care- the republican's fear with obamacare is that it will only lead to businesses laying off employees to cover the cost of mandatory insurance, people with existing plans losing them, and health care in general becoming more expensive for everyone. essentially, that obamacare will do nothing to contain rising costs and lead to a decrease in the quality of health care that people receive. illegal immigration- it is not the folks out working in fields or building houses that republicans are fearful of, it is the drug smugglers, human traffickers, and terrorists that exploit porous borders. they look at the violent crime and drug smuggling some illegals have brought and have said ""no more!"". by the letter of the law, entering and remaining in the country without permission is illegal, regardless of their intentions. so either we enforce the law and deport them or allow the ones we want to be citizens to stay, as it should be. middle east- many republicans didn't want us to pull out until we could be confident that we had actually accomplished our goals, that leaving the job half-finished would mean a resurgence of terror and the collapse of the states we were trying to build. poverty, wealth inequality, and welfare- the problem a lot of conservative have with welfare is that philosophically, they see it as breeding dependency on the government. while most of the poor are exceptionally hard working, it becomes impossible for many long term-poor to get off of welfare once they are on. if the government pays for your food, housing, and basic needs, then what happens when you start making more and no longer qualify for those programs? they fear that the poor who can start to lift themselves out of poverty will be left in worse shape when they no longer qualify for that safety yet. or worse yet, that people who otherwise could pay for their basic needs will exploit the programs intended for the actual poor. the worst case scenario that republicans fear is that if one day we can no longer afford these social safety nets, they will need to be cut so severely that millions of americans are left high and dry. gay marriage- for some conservatives, supporting it would violate their morals. others would allow civil unions but do not think full marriage is necessary. a few think of it as trivial since gay couples are not denied freedom to vote, work, attend school, etc., they are after a piece of paperwork. police brutality- some officers have used excessive force and should be disciplined appropriately, with a thorough and transparent investigation. republicans want accountability and justice, but they also acknowledge that the police's function is to maintain order. if a person resists arrest or tries to assault an officer, that officer is authorized to use force to control the situation. climate change- yes, some repub. leaders have stuck their head in the sand and refuse to believe that it is happening. but in general, many conservatives believe that our strategy to combat climate change, putting up wind farm, solar plants, using ethanol fuel, and buying electric cars, is completely ineffective and will only cripple the economy. marijuana- conservatives drew the line in the sand at marijuana because they feared what would be the next drug up for legalization; heroin?, cocaine?, meth? as a matter of rights, yes you have the right to put whatever in our body you want. but in their mind, the damage to society of legalizing drugs, even the milder drugs like weed, is a worse outcome than suppressing your right to get stoned. tl;dr-republicans are not deliberately malicious. they mean well, but are very distrustful of the ability of government to solve people's problems. and above all else, are fearful of what the change progressives propose might lead to.",ct8djlc,417.2690669026904,1,1437285476,93,15,-12596,0,54.698780797371995,724.0,1132.0,37.0,1,0.02702702702702703,0.02702702702702703,0.1891891891891892,0.05405405405405406,0.0,0.02702702702702703,0.02702702702702703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08108108108108109,0.0,0.43243243243243246,0.050210333421117734,0.30939226519337015,0.0,0,0.0,730,73.65,67.43,7.43,1.12,22.12,23.42,86.44,50.14,11.23,5.34,0.14,1.64,0.68,0.00,2.88,5.89,6.44,13.70,9.45,2.47,6.44,2.19,16.71,6.30,3.15,1.10,0.55,2.60,6.85,1.78,5.07,1.10,0.68,0.27,8.77,0.41,0.00,0.00,0.00,14.52,1.37,3.15,3.70,2.47,1.10,4.25,1.10,0.41,0.14,0.55,1.92,0.27,1.23,0.27,0.14,13.01,2.19,2.60,6.58,0.68,2.19,1.51,12.47,1.37,10.27,2.33,5.75,2.33,4.52,0.41,0.27,2.60,0.14,0.14,0.41,0.00,0.00,0.27,0.14,0.00,14.52,4.11,6.16,0.14,0.27,0.55,0.41,1.78,0.27,0.82,0.00,0.00
t3_3dsku2,"i had a comment earlier today in the cmv about left-wing bias in r/politics that was very relevant to this, so i will just copy and paste it again here. first, though, i want to point out that republicans have a diverse set of beliefs, and not all of them espouse all of the different opinions you mentioned. that being said, i think the primary differences between the two parties are in their economic policies, and those are the differences i address in my comment. this is from my earlier comment: ...poverty rates are consistently higher in nonmetro areas. the idea that republicans are all self-serving corporate fat cats that do not care about the poor while democrats just want to selflessly serve the greater good is a prime example of the sort of bias that arises when people are only surrounded by like-minded opinions. it goes for both sides. i live in a very rural part of the country, and many people here think that democratic politicians are a bunch of elitist academics with their heads in the clouds who do not understand the plight of the working man. the fact that american politics is so strongly divided along urban/rural lines only makes this worse; both parties are rarely exposed to the other side. i'm willing to bet that the majority of r/politics, and reddit as a whole, has spent the majority of their lives in the cities or suburbs. if that's the case, it is easy to see why the more business oriented economic policies of the right would come across as catering exclusively to the rich. when nearly all your employment options involve large corporations, you are going to want more government oversight to keep those corporations in check. it is a whole different story when you live in a small town whose entire economy is based on the few small businesses their population is capable of supporting. increasing taxes on business owners and using that money to expand public services sounds like a great idea if your population density is high enough, but to the residents of rural areas it sounds an awful lot like money that's going to leave their already struggling community and never return. every dollar spent by federal and state governments on public services is going to go a whole lot further in locations where there are a lot of people within a short distance to enjoy it. it costs a bunch more to spread those services over a wider area, and at a certain point it becomes more beneficial to just let the people keep the money and look after themselves.",ct8e7c9,191.89506899776114,1,1437287248,93,15,-10824,0,47.600227272727295,440.0,683.0,16.0,1,0.0625,0.0,0.0625,0.4375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1875,0.0,0.75,0.03876357560568087,0.29772727272727273,0.0,0,0.0,445,83.72,59.77,47.83,64.12,29.67,20.67,89.21,50.79,11.24,4.72,2.02,0.00,1.12,0.00,1.57,6.52,9.44,14.16,7.19,5.84,5.17,0.90,13.71,8.31,4.49,1.57,0.45,5.62,4.04,2.92,0.90,0.22,0.00,0.00,7.42,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.22,10.11,1.57,0.90,1.35,2.25,2.02,3.15,1.12,0.45,0.67,0.00,1.12,0.45,0.90,0.00,0.22,7.42,0.90,0.90,4.72,0.90,0.22,2.02,10.56,0.90,15.28,1.80,10.34,3.15,5.39,0.67,0.45,4.04,0.22,0.00,0.67,0.00,0.67,0.00,0.00,0.00,9.44,4.04,2.92,0.22,0.22,0.00,0.00,0.67,0.00,0.67,0.00,0.67

t3_3cm4z2,"memorizing all the kanji needed for daily use does take a while. but it is not significantly harder than memorizing the kana. in some ways it can be easier (though it does help if you have a good method). it just takes longer, because there are more of them. even though not all kanji are pictographs many patterns are reused as components of other kanji and give hints to their use and their pronunciation (if you are familiar with what they are made up of). for example you can find ? in as a component of a lot of kanji. these kanji often have to do with time. ? - time, ? - day of the week, ? - noon, ? - evening, ? - yesterday, ? - time interval. the repeated pattern aids recognition. when learning the kana there is no pattern. it is straight memorization of random symbols (that is unless you know which kanji the character was derived from. but even then they get pretty abstracted: ? vs ?) being familiar with components can sometimes give you hints to pronunciation too: ? ? ? ? ? - all of these can be pronounced ??. furthermore the uniqueness of kanji helps get across meaning much more quickly than hiragana. if you know the kanji you can read them much faster than hiragana. knowing the meaning of kanji also helps you learn new words. say ?? is a new word to you, but you know ? as house and ? as fee. even without knowing how to pronounce it you can continue reading fairly confident that ?? means rent. whereas if the sentence had just had ??? you would have look it up. admittedly not all words are made up of kanji that break apart so neatly, but knowing the individual meanings can still be helpful for remembering the combined meaning. ?? is made up of ? exertion and ? strong. that does not immediately call to mind study. but maybe you could think of it as exertion to make you strong -> training -> study. then there is the homophone problem. japanese has a lot! the most of almost any other language iirc. one of my favorite words in japanese is ????. it has over a dozen different meanings: pickles ??, progress ??, middle of the night ??, giving a lecture in the emperor's presence ??, invasion, good friendship ??, intimacy ??, emergent ??, deep plowing ??, sailing on ??, benevolence ??, deep crimson ??, eye of a needle ??, etc. ever wondered why puns are so common in japanese jokes? there's also this sentence. [?????????????????????](are 816 ways to parse this sentence. i am not sure if *all* of them are grammatically valid but with kanji they are still understandable. spacing will not quite remove the ambiguity do to homophones (is ?? garden or 2 birds, is ? a particle or a number?). even without homophones this sentence would be hard to read in hiragana. ???? ?? ?? ?? ? ? ?? ???? ? ??? ???????????????? in the backyard there are two chickens in the front yard there are two chickens with regard to your point about writing time, that's become much less significant thanks to computers. it is just as easy for me to type ?? as it is to type ???. in your class you are taught the 'proper' way to write and you are right, nobody's got time for that. when native people write, they tend to right fairly quickly only following the general idea of the stroke order. this is enough to get the easily recognizable form across without tedious calligraphy (though it will be harder to read if you are not used to it, but hey it is hard to read hand written hiragana by native writers). main points: - learning kanji is not so bad. knowing some will help you learn the others. - people can recognize and interpret kanji much faster than they can hiragana. - kanji provide clues to the meaning of the words they make up. - hiragana are ambiguous due to japanese having a large number of homophones - kanji let you pack a lot of information into a small space. - you will likely type kanji more often than you will write them in the real world. - even if you write kanji quickly and sloppily it can still be legible. - bonus point: kanji are just prettier.",csx4q5a,4000.157090153485,1,1436424146,47,8,20846,0,75.17306173931945,671.0,988.0,96.0,1,0.03125,0.0,0.10416666666666667,0.14583333333333334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010416666666666666,0.0,0.010416666666666666,0.03125,0.0,0.33333333333333337,NaN,0.23248882265275708,0.0,0,0.0,674,60.94,59.97,53.42,75.35,10.37,18.84,82.79,52.82,10.68,5.79,0.45,0.00,3.56,0.00,1.78,4.90,6.08,13.95,11.28,5.79,6.97,1.93,17.80,6.97,3.86,0.89,0.89,3.12,3.71,3.12,0.45,0.00,0.00,0.00,7.72,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,17.66,4.90,1.63,1.78,4.30,1.19,6.38,1.34,0.30,0.15,0.89,0.59,0.30,0.30,0.15,0.00,4.60,0.74,0.45,2.37,1.48,0.30,2.08,13.80,1.04,11.57,1.04,5.49,5.34,3.12,0.59,0.74,0.45,0.00,0.00,0.15,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,35.91,6.53,3.86,0.74,0.00,18.69,0.15,2.52,0.00,0.89,1.63,0.89
t3_300pmw,"before i state my view on this i would like to say that it is apparent (whether true or not i just mean visible) that women are more aggressively propositioned than men are. that being said i have been propositioned by both men and women. i can only think of one occasion where a man has propositioned me and he was definitely persistent; though that may have been because i was not clear enough or he was too drunk to realize. the problem is not a matter of empathy, but a matter of communication and entitlement. a pleasant conversation between two people at a club can be interpreted as friendly or flirting. alcohol sure as hell does not help make intentions clearer. i believe that drunk people are like children. they feel everything to excess. anger, happiness, sadness, arousal, and really any other emotion seems to be amplified. this is why people do stupid things when they are hammered. alcohol does also impair decision making, so the rational thought ""hey i probably should leave this girl alone."" does not occur. i do not think harassing men would do very much to help the situation. this is because the people who make the bar/club unsafe for women are not the people who would see the error of their ways. rape is an act of power and therefore placing a person willing to rape in a situation in which they would feel helpless could actually do the opposite of the desired effect. i would also like to state that most guys do not ignore that type of shit. if you see that shit happen at a club/bar try telling a random group of guys what is happening. regardless if you know them or what is happening they will come to help you and the victim. i understand what you mean though, most people do not notice it or are willfully ignorant. putting someone in the situation where they are forced to witness what is happening will force them to act. especially if they are in greater number. nobody wants to act alone, but everyone wants to be apart of the crowd doing the right thing. to sum it up: placing gay propositioners will do nothing (in my opinion) to make bars/clubs safer. showing bar/club goers that that sort of behavior will. so we should ban all alcohol. just kidding alcohol fucking rules.",cpo5gbr,324.9778514730692,1,1427136856,120,22,9031,0,67.9151153846154,400.0,583.0,26.0,1,0.07692307692307693,0.038461538461538464,0.07692307692307693,0.23076923076923078,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.04666666666666666,0.2575,0.0,0,0.0,404,31.55,50.99,23.09,5.05,15.54,18.81,92.33,56.93,15.10,7.43,3.47,0.25,0.99,0.50,2.23,7.67,5.69,10.40,13.37,5.20,6.93,2.72,21.53,5.45,2.72,2.97,0.50,1.98,8.17,2.72,4.70,0.00,2.48,0.99,13.12,0.00,0.74,0.99,1.98,22.03,4.21,3.22,3.96,4.70,2.48,6.93,2.48,1.49,0.50,0.50,4.21,0.74,0.99,1.24,2.48,7.67,3.71,0.50,2.97,0.50,0.74,1.49,14.60,1.73,6.44,0.99,3.96,1.49,0.00,3.71,0.00,0.00,0.25,0.00,1.24,0.99,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,11.39,6.44,1.98,0.25,0.25,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.50,0.00,0.99,0.99

t3_3e76cv,"there is something involved in rap called ""flow"" that is unique to the artform, separating it from poetry. i have a hard time explaining it in text, because it is something that you just can't translate well. it is almost like a rhythm or meter, but that *also* exists in rap; it has more to do with cadence, but it is more fluid than that word typically implies; it has to do with how you say what you are saying and your transitions between words, lines, etc; it is partly influenced by the beat, but it is really the substitution for melody. >it's not usually done with instruments besides drums, save for a few riffs on the chorus i'm not sure where you are getting this idea; i might give it to you if you said ""percussion"" but off the top of my head, some of the best rap tracks have production that feature predominant piano, bass (guitar or stand-up), guitar, glockenspiel, flute, and other instrumentation. while it is true that all a rapper *needs* is a bass beat, but most producers make it more complicated than that. if you listen closely, pretty much every rap beat has *at least* a bass riff backing it along the drum. of the rap songs i can think of off the top of my head: *survival* by eminem features a prominent guitar riff throughout *big pimpin* by jay-z features a flute throughout *gangsta's paradise* by coolio features violins *still d.r.e.* by dr. dre and snoop dog features a bass and a glockenspiel *cleanin' out my closet* by eminem features a bass riff *the real slim shady* by eminem features a synth riff throughout every modern rap song produced by dj mustard is mostly overblown synth lines almost to the exclusion of percussion, aside from sometimes a clapping back track with the occasional ""ey! ey! ey! ey!"" track. (and i do not consider these to be good rap beats at all). the more i think about it, the more i think that this is simply misinformed somehow, and i am curious what rap you are listening to where there is not instrumentation in the production. >music can be about a story, but usually is about emotions like love. this... really depends on the music you listen to, and i would contend that even discounting rap it is way more split down the middle than that. there are entire concept albums devoted to retelling stories, a-la *city of evil* by avenged sevenfold which is supposed to be a concept album around *fear and loathing in las vegas*. >rapping is mostly about the story- like narrative poetry again, it depends on the rapping, but by and large you have to make the story fit the mood, or the mood fit the story. a rap like *gangsta's paradise* wouldn't fit if coolio was rapping over the beat to *still d.r.e*; it does not fit the mood at all. the story does inform the mood, but the production does indeed have to have the right mood. i agree that rap takes elements from spoken-word poetry, but if bill shatner's performance of ""rocket man"" can still be music, why can't rap? (and if you disagree on rocket man by the shatner, then i will have to find a different approach, but i think that is *fairly* well accepted to be music). finally, the final litmus test for me: when i am cruising down the highway, i *will* find myself listening to rap. i *won't* find myself listening to poetry. poetry is enjoyed in much the same vein as other ""high"" art; it is usually a quiet atmosphere. rap is meant to be enjoyed in rowdy concerts like other popular music genres, and is presented musically (if not melodically). even if i were to put on poetry, it would *feel* wrong, in a way that rap simply doesn't.",ctc47tf,585.2912517595591,1,1437578701,50,9,1199,0,65.48742424242425,648.0,930.0,33.0,64,0.09090909090909091,0.0,0.3939393939393939,0.2727272727272727,0.0,0.0,0.09090909090909091,0.0,0.09090909090909091,0.0,0.0,0.06060606060606061,0.06060606060606061,0.06060606060606061,1.121212121212121,NaN,0.24382716049382716,0.0,0,0.0,656,69.75,35.14,44.19,63.34,24.30,16.01,83.54,55.03,12.04,5.18,3.35,0.00,1.83,0.00,0.00,6.86,8.08,13.87,9.76,5.95,5.79,1.68,14.48,5.03,3.66,1.22,0.15,2.90,4.12,2.59,0.61,0.15,0.00,0.00,5.49,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.30,15.85,2.44,2.13,1.83,4.88,1.37,6.10,5.95,0.00,5.64,0.30,0.61,0.46,0.00,0.00,0.00,3.66,0.15,1.22,2.59,0.76,0.15,1.37,11.89,0.76,10.06,0.61,6.86,2.74,1.07,5.95,0.15,0.30,0.30,0.00,0.91,0.00,0.30,0.30,0.30,0.00,22.71,4.57,5.34,0.30,0.91,0.15,0.61,0.76,1.52,1.68,1.22,5.64

[npr did a great series](on how the global economic boom created this unprecedented pile of money that needed to be invested somewhere, which lead to the popularity of ""mortgage-backed securities"", which lead to stupid loans, which lead to the global economic collapse. there's no question that the amount of [disposable income in countries like china](has increased dramatically, and poverty has decreased. yes, the distribution of wealth is still screwed, but there is vastly more wealth, which is benefiting many poorer countries. **tl;dr: it was a time of missed opportunities, and some screw ups, but i do not think it was a tipping point as you suggest, and that even had gore been elected, things wouldn't have been dramatically different.**",cu2q2lr,416.1734948042463,1,1439561567,79,20,5372,0,58.151005208333345,512.0,795.0,30.0,130,0.03333333333333333,0.0,0.36666666666666664,0.26666666666666666,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7666666666666666,0.007445141065830721,0.31640625,0.0,0,0.0,520,61.68,42.37,25.86,50.92,17.33,22.31,84.62,52.50,11.92,5.00,1.73,0.96,0.38,1.92,0.00,6.73,7.88,11.54,12.88,3.08,5.00,2.88,17.69,5.58,3.27,1.73,1.35,2.12,6.92,4.04,2.69,0.96,0.96,0.38,6.73,0.38,0.19,0.19,2.12,14.62,2.12,2.31,2.88,2.50,0.77,4.81,0.77,0.00,0.38,0.19,0.96,0.19,0.19,0.38,0.00,10.00,1.73,2.88,5.00,0.96,1.15,5.58,9.04,0.58,13.27,2.69,7.88,2.50,4.23,0.96,0.38,2.69,0.38,0.00,1.15,0.58,0.00,0.58,0.00,0.00,22.12,5.77,5.38,0.19,0.19,0.00,0.00,0.58,1.54,1.54,1.15,5.77
t3_2vxtol,"circumcising culture and growing up circumcised tend to make people see the foreskin as a deformity rather than a normal part of the human penis. if you thought the foreskin looked like it was supposed to be there instead of thinking that penises are supposed to look circumcised, the circumcised penis might look like something painful happened to it. it takes weeks if not months for a penis to accumulate smegma. myths about smegma are extremely exaggerated in circumcising cultures. this appears to be cultural defensiveness. the skin of the circumcised penis is often wrinklier unless the surgery made the skin very tight. the skin of the unmodified penis can be moved back to achieve a very similar aesthetic. for most penises, the skin stays back easily and retracts automatically with erection at least to some extent. of course, this aesthetic argument should not have any bearing on whether children's genitals should be modified without consent or any medical indication. the main argument against non-therapeutic circumcision is that the foreskin is a sensory structure of the penis that contributes a significant part of the feeling of the penis. of course, i wouldn't expect it to change your opinion, but it is worth pointing out that in all cultures with cultural genital cuttings, a synthetic cultural aesthetic standard is applied to the appearance of the genitalia. the cultural idea that the penis should be destructively simplified to an uncomplicated rod is like the idea that the female genitalia should be surgically simplified however those cultures want it to be. * i think you might want to see a doctor if you are getting smegma more quickly. or you might want to change your diet or something. that's not normal.",colviyq,188.2176590233052,1,1423975367,62,7,4373,0,42.68086875725902,287.0,491.0,15.0,2,0.06666666666666667,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.13333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,0.11848330241187384,0.26480836236933797,0.0,0,0.0,288,89.26,51.39,3.90,12.09,19.20,29.17,84.38,52.08,9.03,2.78,0.69,0.00,2.08,0.00,0.00,6.25,10.76,14.93,9.72,3.82,4.51,1.74,17.71,3.47,3.12,0.35,0.00,3.12,1.74,0.35,1.39,0.00,0.69,0.00,6.94,0.00,0.00,0.35,0.00,18.40,2.08,1.39,4.51,6.94,0.69,6.25,4.86,2.43,0.00,2.43,8.68,6.60,2.08,5.21,0.35,2.43,0.00,0.35,1.04,1.39,0.00,2.43,11.11,1.39,5.90,2.08,3.12,2.08,1.39,0.00,0.00,0.35,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,9.03,5.21,2.08,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.35,0.00,1.04,0.00,0.35

great, but can you score against the italian *zona mista* defense? that's why football announcers *flip the fuck out* when a goal is scored. because the difficulty is so high, because points are so rare, and because single goals can change the entire outcome of a match, it is hugely exciting (or heartbreaking) when somebody finally gets through. this by the way is also why ""ball control"" can be so erratic, and turnovers so frequent. basically in order to break through a determined defense, you have to take risks. to move the ball quickly enough to get around defenders (while respecting the off-sides rule), you have to make long shots, or an attacker has to make runs through multiple defenders. **by the way, *soccer is hard*** american football players have to catch a ball from 20-60 yards away while running. football players have to *kick* a ball, or head-butt it, towards very small targets, from distances more like 40-80 yards. basketball is basically soccer with hands, and skilled players have incredible control. in soccer, or ""basketball with feet,"" control is inherently more difficult, and this also leads to many turnovers. that said, there are some players and teams who are renowned for their elegant and jaw-dropping skill at passing, breaking tackles, etc. [ronaldinho, zidane, and bergkamp](soccer is hard, but players who are truly good at it are phenomenal to watch. **an everyman sport** it's just a ball, some guys and a field. that's it. no special equipment necessary. with the little equipment there is (ball, cleats, shinguards), the difference between cheap and expensive is very small. the poorest countries on earth can afford to field soccer teams, and that means that you have one of the widest possible talent pools in all of team sports. everyone can play, everyone can relate to players, everyone can imagine themselves getting good enough to compete at the highest levels. **fan intensity** this goes especially during world cup time, but there is nothing more exhilarating than watching a world cup match with a bunch of people rooting for the same country. the ""world series"" in baseball actually only includes 3-4 countries, but the ""world cup"" brings with it intense nationalism, patriotism and pride. the emotional stakes are higher. players generally play for their own country on the various national teams, so each team really does represent the country. i call it ""world war cup,"" because that's what it feels like. **sheer athleticism** it's probably no surprise if you have watched a match, and realize that soccer pitches can be anywhere from 100-130 yards long and 50-100 yards wide, but soccer players run a lot. according to [this gizmodo piece](they easily run twice in a match as much as any other major sport. basketball: 2 miles. football: maximum 1.25 miles. tennis (5 sets): 3 miles. baseball: lol. soccer: up to 9.5 miles. can you imagine any other team sport where players run a 15k while competing all-out at a professional level? the grueling, punishing physicality of the game adds to the intense drama. **see for yourself** to give you an idea of all that i am talking about here, watch [the highlight reel from the 2010 world cup final](spain vs. netherlands, two relatively clean-playing, hard-hitting squads and about as good a matchup as you could hope for. 0-0 the score through 90 minutes of regular time. attack after attack mounted by each team, repulsed at the last grueling moment by defenders. the netherlands has two of the deadliest strikers in the game in robben and van persie, and spain is known for its elegant, surgical ball control and passing (which you can see some of in the highlights). the game goes into extra time and it is only at the 27 minute mark that spain finally scores the cup-winning goal, the crowd explodes, spain explodes, everyone watching around the world is exhausted, the match could have gone either way for almost two solid hours. incredible stuff. note: i apologize for the vuvuzelas. fifa apologizes for the vuvuzelas. africa apologizes. the world apologizes. i do not know how anyone could have sat in the stadium for hours listening to those damn things without going freaking insane. i hope to god they have been banned from every sporting event ever, for the rest of time. at any rate, they weren't allowed in brazil 2014.",cpj9uww,2294.2605090888537,1,1426721464,39,12,10392,0,65.17206938159882,884.0,1324.0,60.0,24,0.06666666666666667,0.0,0.11666666666666667,0.21666666666666667,0.03333333333333333,0.016666666666666666,0.0,0.016666666666666666,0.016666666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05,0.03333333333333333,0.5666666666666667,0.06420000110901093,0.26018099547511314,0.0,0,0.0,924,85.60,59.84,37.24,22.42,16.21,21.86,82.79,46.86,8.12,3.14,0.76,0.00,1.62,0.00,0.76,4.98,8.33,13.74,7.25,5.09,5.84,1.41,11.80,4.87,2.16,1.08,4.11,3.68,5.63,2.71,2.92,0.11,0.87,0.11,6.60,0.00,0.32,0.00,0.22,11.47,1.30,2.60,0.87,3.03,1.84,3.03,1.73,0.87,0.22,0.65,1.08,0.65,0.22,0.11,0.11,10.17,1.84,2.60,3.57,3.03,1.30,1.08,10.93,0.43,14.83,2.16,8.23,4.44,2.49,6.28,0.00,0.32,0.11,0.11,0.76,0.54,0.22,0.00,0.00,0.00,23.48,5.95,6.39,0.65,0.00,0.32,0.00,1.62,1.08,0.87,1.41,5.19

t3_3efvfu,"i have a degree in britneyology and here is my pov: in the time before the drama (2003-2005) she had begun to be more hands on with her music than ever before with her label fighting her the entire time. they actually scrapped her entire concept album that she and her producers bloodshy and avant had been working on. then she had to take a break during her pregnancy but was more determined than ever to be in control of her music. so she fired her long time manager and started working with a woman named theresa labarbara whites. together they challenged up and commer danja as well as b&a and long time friend, pharrell, to create a fresh new sound. word on the street is that britney was extremely picky and wanted nothing to do with what she called ""same old boring"" stuff on the radio. i am sure she planned on having personal ballads but after her divorce she was adamant about leaving out any songs regarding her personal life. the end result was blackout. the first and only album where she was executive producer. which brings me to my first point. britney had never been anything short of professional and dedicated and was the promo queen. blackout would have obliterated her current contemporaries and would have set an extremely high bar for them in the future. just check out any songs off the album and it is easy to see how everyone started going in the electro dance pop route which then went full on edm. she had a solid album, her magnum opus. we could no longer chastise her for being a puppet or say she owed her success to writers/producers. she would have effortlessly changed the game and could have possibly snatched the crown to become the queen of pop. unfortunately, her breakdown became such a focus that blackout fell by the wayside. which brings me to my second point: even though her numbers post breakdown were highly successful, it was at the expense of her new found artistry. the conservatorship stripped her of any decision making and that manager she fired was immediately rehired. he spun her breakdown into the obvious ""comeback"" (which she has stated that she hated that term) to generate public interest and it became a thing to root for her. he was exec producer of circus, which she did write a couple songs on, but was all over the place. femme fatale was the first time she had 3 top ten hits from one album. again this was at the expense of her artistry. she had her own idea and sound already in the works but was overruled when dr luke was hired as exec producer who then scrapped all her songs and the final track listing was 90% producers and writers signed to his label. britney jean was a rushed mess and will.i.am scammed britney. i know it is a lot. tl;dr: her breakdown didn't make her more successful, it was spun and marketed as a comeback to generate publicity. not her decision and not genuine. when actually her album blackout could have possibly launched her into an even bigger super star than before based solely on her own merit.",cto3uw6,2601.835637785198,1,1438457467,17,7,711170,8,64.36407662789304,538.0,794.0,31.0,1,0.06451612903225806,0.0,0.12903225806451613,0.12903225806451613,0.03225806451612903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0967741935483871,0.0,0.4516129032258065,0.012380952380952381,0.30297397769516726,0.0,0,0.0,547,54.74,78.41,6.06,38.79,18.86,17.92,85.01,55.03,15.54,11.33,1.65,0.18,0.00,8.96,0.55,4.20,6.95,12.25,10.05,4.39,6.95,1.10,15.90,6.40,3.29,2.01,1.83,2.19,4.02,2.19,1.46,0.00,0.37,0.00,12.98,0.37,0.18,9.14,0.55,12.61,1.83,3.29,1.28,1.46,2.38,2.56,2.19,0.18,1.83,0.18,1.10,0.18,0.73,0.18,0.18,7.50,0.91,3.29,3.29,0.73,0.37,8.41,4.94,1.10,15.90,2.19,6.95,6.40,4.94,2.01,0.00,0.73,0.00,0.18,0.37,0.00,0.18,0.00,0.18,0.00,10.24,5.67,1.46,0.55,0.18,0.00,0.00,0.18,0.73,0.18,0.73,0.55

t3_3f18mt,"mlb - it is a pass time, baseball is a long, slow grind that builds up gradually and does not matter much until the end of the season, this falls into your view of ""not mattering a whole lot"" nhl - also my favorite sport, and depending on your team there are three categories that they will fall into: obviously making it into the playoffs (chicago, anaheim, tampa, pittsburgh). obviously *not* making the playoffs (new jersey, arizona, philadelphia, toronto, whatever the expansion teams will be), and finally bubble teams (ottowa, columbus, minnesota, edmonton^maybe , buffalo^maybe^unlikely ) for the ""gonna make it"" teams, there is not much on the line other than home ice advantage, though that does not mean much, so the big thing is seeing the team progress and develop and making sure players are healthy, not terribly compelling. for the bubble teams, this is where it gets interesting, you are talking about battles *all season long*, the wins *matter* when the team is only 2 points out of the wild card, the last 2 months of the season are frantic, with everyone trying to fight their way into the playoffs, for some people it is as good as playoff hockey from february on. for the ""obviously not going to make it"" teams, the regular season matters the *most* to them! it is all they have and if the team realizes it early enough and there is a highly touted prospect on the board next season (like austin matthews) it is incredibly important that the team does poorly. i am a sabres fan and this last season was one of the most tense and compelling i have watched in years, because they *needed* to finish last. so in the nhl for the majority of the teams at least half of the regular season is extremely important for either making the playoffs, or getting into last for the best chance at the top draft pick. nfl - i saved this for last because i almost can't believe that you feel the games are important. there are only 16 games each season! any single game can and does mean the difference between making the playoffs and going home at the end of december. even if a team is bad games have *massive* implications because drafting is so important in the nfl. compared to baseball or hockey, each nfl game counts for 10 baseball games, or 5 nhl games, all in one day! you have the majority of the games against teams that are constant rivals, that are battling for just 2 or 3 playoff spots available. so much in the nfl can swing on one weekend that it is almost *too* important! tl:dr - i pretty much agree with baseball, but the nhl and especially the nfl every single game matters for most teams.",ctkcw2a,848.7042924526504,1,1438188090,26,9,3145,0,56.53268115942031,460.0,648.0,15.0,10,0.13333333333333333,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.6,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.13333333333333333,0.06666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.06666666666666667,1.2,0.15781797567511852,0.24782608695652175,0.0,0,0.0,471,79.59,55.90,44.51,53.72,31.40,17.41,84.93,49.89,8.92,3.40,1.27,0.00,1.06,0.00,1.06,5.52,9.77,11.89,7.86,5.31,6.79,1.70,12.95,5.52,2.76,0.64,2.97,5.10,4.88,3.18,1.70,0.42,0.64,0.00,7.86,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,14.44,1.27,3.18,0.64,4.46,2.34,4.46,0.85,0.64,0.00,0.21,0.21,0.00,0.21,0.00,0.00,9.55,4.88,4.25,3.18,1.27,0.21,0.64,9.77,1.27,13.80,1.70,5.73,6.58,3.18,6.58,0.42,0.21,0.00,0.00,0.42,0.00,0.21,0.21,0.00,0.00,18.47,2.34,7.22,0.42,0.00,0.00,0.85,0.85,1.27,0.21,1.70,3.61
t3_3kbjtc,"i do not think a family section is a terrible idea, but as a mom i have some concerns. as for children playing together/roaming and parents being less stressed in having to keep them in check: kids together have a synergistic effect, and potentially roaming, playing toddlers with relaxed parents would likely be a safety issue. also, i am shooting for a certain kind of behavior with my kids, and will come prepared, and kids behaving differently will make it harder on me. which is my next argument. if i have to fly with my children (i have not flown since my first was a toddler) i will be planning it out to ensure it is the least stressful experience for everyone. i know i have kids, but i work hard to make sure they behave. i honestly do not want to be packed in with other people's obnoxious kids. babies are the least of my irritation. put on some noise-canceling headphones. but headphones will not keep that 10 year old from kicking your seat for 800 miles. otherwise, it has potential. the rear seats are the safest and being close to the bathroom is nice. i doubt babies would set each other off in flight, it is pretty loud, but if you are stuck on the runway they definitely would. if the seats were configured to be family-friendly, like train seats, it would be even better. i would pay more for that with a family of five!",cuwa6pq,523.0317544347608,1,1441851601,256,38,-20209,0,69.82314634146344,246.0,350.0,15.0,1,0.06666666666666667,0.06666666666666667,0.26666666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.0,0.4666666666666667,0.04523809523809524,0.2682926829268293,0.0,0,0.0,250,55.96,35.93,54.00,70.90,16.67,18.40,89.20,55.60,14.00,9.20,7.20,0.00,0.80,0.00,1.20,4.80,6.00,13.20,14.40,1.20,6.40,1.60,20.40,5.20,4.00,0.40,1.60,3.20,8.40,5.20,2.80,1.60,0.80,0.00,10.40,3.20,0.40,0.40,0.00,15.60,1.60,1.60,3.60,4.00,1.60,6.00,2.00,0.00,0.80,0.80,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,7.60,3.20,2.40,0.80,0.40,1.20,1.60,12.40,3.20,10.40,2.40,6.00,2.00,0.80,2.80,1.60,0.40,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,13.60,5.60,4.80,0.40,0.00,0.00,0.40,0.80,0.00,0.40,0.80,0.40
t3_3kbjtc,"i just took a trip involving my wife and two boys (3) and (4 months) that was a 4 hour flight each way. while i do not agree they should be forced to sit in a section, we actually grab the last or second to last seat as we get drinks faster and easier access to bathroom. >1. obviously most people traveling without small children would feel happy not having to be seated closer to children for the duration of their flight. i do not like getting seated to smelly people and fat people. usually these go hand and hand. i really do not like sitting next to the guy that smoked a half pack before the flight. we all suck it up and realize a flight is just a temporary surrounding. >2. the children would have other children around them as playmates to keep them occupied. this would make the kids less bored. this usually ia a negative than a positive. kids get rowdy with other kids, talking, yelling, playing with toys. babies wake other babies when they cry. it is why parents split up kids at night. you never put a newborn in a room with a toddler. if one is up, they are both up. >3. the parents / guardians would feel less stressed out over having to discipline their kids and keep them quiet because they are surrounded by other people in a similar situation as themselves. alot of parents do not want things to get out of hand. my wife and i want a quiet flight. we get the kids in nap mode and we get a few drinks. my wife and i take turns napping with a kid. our flights are actually pretty relaxing. what kills us is the taxis, security (tough even in express lane when tsa is bomb testing all bottles and medicine) and the luggage is just killer. not all parents are this way. we have taken 7 flights with my son and this was first with second. we have not encountered parents with screaming kids or parents with a lack of interest in shutting up their kid. i have encountered more people playing music on speaker super loudly. in fact we had a girl blasting music right behind me on our departing flight. i have 2 sleeping kids and some one is blasting music. it was not like she lost control of her phone and it was playing her the song of its people. >4. parents / guardians could even help each other out with their kids, or if someone needs an extra diaper / sippy cup / cracker / etc there would be people very close by you could ask. meh. usually you run out of wipes before diapers. airlines can manifest wipes of need be. >5. if the children wanted to get up and roam around a little, there would be greater understanding from other passengers since they are in a similar situation. maybe from passengers would understand but airlines really frown upon it. most flights i am on they hit their cruising altitude, tell you that you can move about the cabin. they leave seat belt sign on and if they catch you walking or lingering they say to take a seat as the light is on. >6. in case of an emergency it would be a simple task to prioritize evacuation of the children first if they are all gathered in one area. feel bad for those people sitting amidst all the kids as kids are not allowed in the exit rows. >7. breastfeeding mothers might feel more at ease breastfeeding openly in an environment with other mothers instead of asshole uptight passengers complaining that they have to cover up / feed the kid at home. my wife is not modest. ask the guy in aisle seat next to us. the guy had to have gotten some good shots. no complaints there. free range feeding is on the rise. >8. it is in close vicinity of the bathroom at the back of the plane. i give you that. except most planes have one at front. >9. when the flight is over, people seated in the child-section could take their time getting off the plane instead of having to rush and pack up all of the toys and worry about bothering others. toys, tablets, food is ready by final descent. one of the advantages of sitting in the back that you didn't mention though is by the time we get in the hallway exiting the plane is our stroller that we ""gate checked"" is there and we are not cluttering up that hallway. making a move to move all parents with children to back would probably cause more problems than solve them. there would be more screaming kids. kids get upset when other kids are upset. one kid gets a snack, the other one doesn't. they dont understand ""possession"". one parent will be trying to get their kid to sleep and another will be handing their kid a tablet to watch a movie. boredom is not always a bad thing. it gets many kids to play quietly by themselves. hitler didn't hate the jews because they didn't accept christ. he hated them because they wouldn't fight with him, they only bought from jews and hoarded their money from german society. it was kind of true, he didn't say it in such a gentle way. he told his people, his country they would be better served if they just moved them to sections of the cities which became the ghettos. they were subjected to a living far below the others. the faa of course would never do this but if they did, the children's section would be a sub section. we all wouldn't be sharing the load (socialism) we would be outing those at a disadvantage for the majority (fascism). hitler was not doing this for the betterment of the jews but himself. i have to say that i feel your post is coming from a idea you have that you think is a win/win but it is really just a selfish desire. your definitely not hitler, you are just trying to justify your idea but you are not informed as a parent who flies regularly. we could force all the sick people in this country to kansas, give them free housing and healthcare and save a ton of money with strict managed care with young medical students and doctor/mentors without need for insurance getting involved and save millions. that is... if you want the 2nd ammendment being exercised daily. don't take anything i say offensively. you put alot of work into your post, i dont mean to pick at it but you formatted it so nicely i was able to respond very easily and on my

t3_3kbjtc,"before i had kids i would agree with most of your proposal. i used to fly 1-3 times a month for work, usually on longer flights (3-9 hours). before i had accumulated enough miles to get the status for upgrades to economy plus or business, the system we bought our work tickets through was a discounter for businesses that offered really good rates on name brand airlines (delta ftw). getting tickets on these systems usually means the airlines assigns you the lowest priority for anything, from boarding to seating options, throwing you in with the value shoppers (as in, most families). the worst thing ever was being so happy to get an aisle seat for the extra leg stretch room then realizing a mom and two toddlers were heading for the seats next to you while you are on a red eye from midwest us to germany and you are counting on getting at least 4 hours of sleep. after having kids, i kind of get it a bit more. i know some parents are shitty and do not handle their kids well, we have all had to deal with the parent dicking around on their ipad ignoring their shitty 4 year old that's running up and down the aisles like they are on a playground. on the other hand, sometimes no matter how well prepared or how good a parent is, a 2 year old is going to have their moments when nothing is going to stop them from having a total meltdown. but, i know how to deal with my kids. you might get a 10 minute outburst on a 5 hour flight, but they will behave for the rest of it because i know how to entertain them. i have ran them down in the terminal before getting on the plane so they are tired and gotten the sillies out, have all the treats they are usually not allowed at home, and have loaded up all of their favorite media on an ipad to play with along with a bunch of books and small toys they favor. in that situation, my kids are nice and calm and can be reasoned with. they get rest, i get rest, and everyone is pretty happy. stick them with 15 other kids from ages 1-6 in a small, cramped cabin, and that all goes out the window. if one gets crazy, all of them want to get crazy no matter what you do. so those parents are suffering through a 5 hour flight trying to keep their kids from herding and running around screaming like it is a playground. it sounds like a good idea, but no parent wants to sit through that. when i get where i am going on a plane, i still need to get the kids though the airport, collect luggage, customs if international, and then acquire transportation. if i am dealing with hyper kids for 5 hours previously, that's not going to go well as the kids are likely to be hard to calm down or they will hit their crashing point then and be having a huge meltdown in the airport/line at hertz and still making other people suffer (and i am probably going to be a huge asshole by that point). another problem is space. families typically have more stuff they need access to more frequently. traveling alone, i usually have a small carry on and a laptop bag, and i will never access the carry on during the flight. with kids, i am in that shit all the time because the darth vader action figure they really wanted is not as cool as it was 20 minutes ago, and i need to get something else to keep them from freaking out. kid leaks through his pull-up because he has scared to go to the bathroom in fight? got to get up and get new clothes. now we all know how cramped overhead bins are, there is no way all of that will fit in one small area, it is better that it is spread out through the plane. i can't sit in a seat with a huge bag of all that shit, so i am getting at my bags more often. so it is likely my stuff will end up getting stashed somewhere up the plane, which means me getting up and constantly shoving my crotch or ass in someone's face while i try to access a bag 7 aisles ahead of me, with a kid that's now freaking out because dad had to walk away from them. lastly, and this is more of a personal problem, is i generally dislike children. i love my own kids, but have little patience for others. so sitting somewhere on a plane where it is guaranteed i am going to have my seat kicked, someone else's kid crawling over my legs, an armrest with another kid's saliva/mucus all over it, screaming in my ear, and so on, is not my idea of something i would pay to do. if this becomes a policy, i am going to want a discount on my airfare because i am receiving less for my money and getting a much more stressful experience.",cuwdlt8,1111.2088026051827,1,1441857751,256,38,-14059,0,66.72293600844006,859.0,1146.0,32.0,7,0.0,0.0,0.21875,0.1875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1875,0.0,0.75,0.039903001638994844,0.22584400465657742,0.0,0,0.0,877,70.69,49.54,76.39,22.24,27.41,15.05,88.71,57.13,14.25,9.12,4.79,0.57,0.91,0.23,2.62,4.90,6.96,16.76,8.55,4.90,7.53,1.37,16.88,5.02,2.85,1.25,2.17,3.19,5.13,2.39,2.62,0.23,0.68,0.46,8.44,1.03,0.00,0.11,0.34,11.97,1.37,1.60,1.71,3.99,1.82,2.96,1.25,0.23,0.46,0.34,2.28,1.82,0.34,0.00,0.00,9.35,1.48,0.80,3.19,3.65,0.46,1.94,11.17,2.28,18.13,3.31,9.12,5.82,1.14,1.48,0.68,1.03,0.00,0.00,1.60,0.91,0.11,0.23,0.34,0.00,10.95,3.53,4.90,0.00,0.00,0.11,0.00,0.46,0.00,0.80,0.91,0.23
t3_3kbjtc,"i do not think it would be pragmatic to implement. it would be really difficult to predict with any accuracy how many children would be on any given flight. even if you modeled over time and came up with some guesstimates averages will never reflect actual flights which could be greatly thrown off by a simple anomaly. a last minute booking by several large families with children could cause a huge change in the population for example. you could not establish where the ""kids zone"" was until you knew how many kids you had. you could not assign anyone seats until the plane was sold out or you established a cutoff point so you knew you had enough seats for the ""kids zone."" it does not make sense to have a cutoff point because airlines of course want to sell every seat they can, and implementing a policy that would in the long run leave more seats unsold via cutoff would raise ticket prices for everyone (not to mention with scratched flights and reroutes, late planes, etc would make last minute changes impossible to avoid anyways). you're then going to have some very unhappy passengers who end up in the ""kids zone"" despite not having kids. if you could assign seats early the idea of ""first come first serve"" would work, but as i have mentioned you realistically can't, and some people not only will end up next to the zone, but it in since it would be an anomaly for the exact number of kids and parents to fit perfectly like tetris pieces in the back of the plane. some people are going to get stuck filling in the odd seats there or we are back to the problem of not selling out planes and rising prices. even if you didn't have a true ""kids section"" and just by default sat all those traveling with children towards the back and filled it with families from 36f or whatever in a line until you ran out that leaves a lot of hectic passenger seating to be arranged at the last minute by the airline, since again you can't issue seats early and which then still could be a nightmare if a last minute change as discussed brought some kids on the plane during that arrangement and seat assigning. it is just not feasible. what is far more realistic is if the airlines rather than have a ""kids zone"" had a ""kids free zone."" you could take the first quarter (or whatever) of coach seats, charge a slightly higher price than regular coach and say that no kids will sit in that area. that way if that's important to you you can pay for a small upgrade, but it does not cause the logistical nightmares of trying to determine how many kids will be on a flight ahead of time. i do not have any empirical data but i fly a lot and pragmatic experience says it would be far easier for an airline to say, ""well we know we will not have so many kids that we would have to put them in these five rows (or whatever) here,"" than it would to say, ""well we know we need this much room for kids."" then you could still assign seats ahead of time. the only problem i see there is if last minute passengers that do not want to pay the extra $25 (or whatever) to be in the kid free zone didn't have any other seat options available. but you have that anyways. as much as i travel it is certainly happened where i have had to pay for business or ""expanded economy"" when coach would be fine but there was no coach available. if they wanted to be nice about it airlines could even waive the extra fee if there were no other sets available.",cuwegwr,1116.3399009398033,1,1441859419,256,38,-12391,0,60.62900412796701,646.0,878.0,21.0,6,0.047619047619047616,0.0,0.42857142857142855,0.5238095238095238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047619047619047616,0.0,0.0,0.19047619047619047,0.047619047619047616,1.2857142857142858,0.08911581474081473,0.19195046439628483,0.0,0,0.0,647,55.54,56.76,47.04,36.66,30.81,13.91,87.64,57.34,11.13,5.41,1.08,0.93,2.94,0.00,0.46,5.72,6.65,14.22,11.75,5.41,7.88,3.25,17.77,4.79,1.85,2.16,0.93,4.02,2.78,1.70,1.08,0.15,0.00,0.15,9.43,0.46,0.00,0.00,0.00,18.86,1.39,2.01,6.03,4.79,1.39,7.26,1.24,0.15,0.62,0.15,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,6.34,1.39,1.24,2.78,0.46,0.62,3.40,9.89,2.16,16.85,3.40,7.42,6.49,2.01,1.55,0.46,2.16,0.00,0.00,0.62,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.31,0.31,10.51,3.25,1.85,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,3.09,0.93,1.24,0.15

t3_3ds3xn,"maybe its the way your post is phrased, but it seems to be assuming that monogamous couples are unwilling or incapable of having mature conversations about certain topics, which i do not really think is fair. there are monogamous couples that *do* talk about these things, just as there are poly couples that do not talk about this at all and as a result end up hurting people. mono or poly, *any* people that want to have a sustained, stable, long term relationship should have discussions about their expectations for the relationship and what they hope to get out of it. to me, some of your comments imply that monogamous couples never do this (they're just taking ""the easy way"") and that poly couples just sort of get this for free, both of which seem wrong to me. if that was not your intent, then i do not know if i really understand your point. in other words, i do not really understand what ""the better solutions"" that you are talking about really are if its not just open and honest communication, which is certainly available to monogamous couples. the other point that i want to make that's sort of on a different thread, but which takes a slightly more cynical view of humans is that sometimes the theoretical ""best way"" is just not a good idea due to having higher chance of failure. for example, beer is great. it tastes good and helps you have fun. really, the ""best"" way for an alcoholic to act would just be to drink responsibly! that way they get to not be an alcoholic *and* enjoy beer! but that's obviously not realistic. many people would try this, and relapse into alcoholism. i would say that avoiding alcohol entirely is a very wise move for many people and i wouldn't call it ""the easy way out"". similarly, i think when dealing with relationships, certain people are tempted by actions that provide short term gains but that have long term risks. you might say that the ""best solution"" is just for everyone to have a good talk about their feelings and then they can do whatever they want somehow, but in practice that will often (not always! depends on the people involved) lead to a great deal of stress, uncertainty and pain that could end a relationship that would have otherwise been successful. and i do not think its practical to just rebut that with ""well, they should have communicated better, so its their own fault"". if there was an ""easy way"" that would have been more likely to result in better long term outcomes for them, then i do not think it makes sense to call the other option ""better"".",ct890o9,374.67054365634584,1,1437274955,61,6,-13163,0,62.06842105263161,456.0,649.0,19.0,54,0.05263157894736842,0.10526315789473684,0.3684210526315789,0.42105263157894735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.05263157894736842,0.05263157894736842,0.15789473684210525,0.0,1.263157894736842,0.04774453941120608,0.20394736842105263,0.0,0,0.0,456,28.89,43.90,38.82,90.71,24.00,15.35,93.20,58.55,16.67,6.14,2.63,0.00,1.54,0.00,1.97,10.53,5.04,11.62,12.06,6.58,6.58,3.07,18.20,6.36,3.07,1.75,0.00,1.97,8.33,6.14,2.19,0.88,0.22,0.44,9.87,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,21.05,3.51,2.41,3.95,5.70,1.97,7.24,1.75,0.22,0.44,0.66,2.41,0.00,1.32,0.00,1.75,8.99,1.75,3.51,1.97,4.17,1.10,0.88,15.35,1.54,9.87,0.66,5.70,3.29,1.10,1.75,0.00,0.22,0.00,0.00,0.22,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.22,0.00,16.01,3.51,4.82,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.66,0.00,3.95,0.88,0.88,1.32

t3_3fveyg,"although you personally do not like tipping, the custom exists for good reason. if people did not tip and servers had to earn their living from only wages, food prices would increase to compensate the additional cost required to sustain the servers. in addition to this, not tipping is typically frowned upon because the stiff is disregarding the server's humanity. eliminating the tip would not save money for anyone in the long run because restaurants will simply up the price of their food. imagine a scenario in which one had to pay $10 + at least 20% tips, thus raising the price to $12. if tipping ceased, the restaurant would simply raise the initial price of the food to $12. the consumer still has to pay the same amount. however, under the tip system, servers can try to provide better service because they have an incentive for doing so. tipping helps both the consumer and the server, and as such, it is more preferrable to tip than provide a base wage. the server is paid a base wage of +/- $2/hour to ensure that they walk home with at least something. it is a protection of their income stability, much like how many salespeople of supermarkets like walmart are paid much lower than what the skill demands because salespeople make commission. the base wage for a server is not meant to sustain the server. it is only meant to be used as a backup if income from tips is too low. servers actually earn their money from providing and enhancing a good service by taking away plates and bringing food to the customer. keep in mind that when consumers pay the price tag for the meal, they are paying only for the cook's labor and the cost of the ingredients. tips are not factored in because they provide an incentive for servers to give giving a better service. while you may argue that cooks should be tipped too under this logic because then cooks have an incentive to cook better, the action is simply unrealistic to implement because a cook spends most of his or her time optimizing efficiency in the kitchen. to have to deal with tips is to immediately handicap the maximum achievement the cooks can accomplish. people who serve are doing so to sustain their families. they try to provide the best service because they need something from you: money. a person who does not tip goves everyone else around him or her that he or she is rich, but chooses to spend cheaply anyway. it is a rude gesture, especially when someone else (the server) is expending a reasonable effort to provide the consumer with a better environment surrounding a meal. tipping shows some respect to the server, which is arguably more important than saving $2 here and there. it is common knowledge that people didn't pay for the service up front and that stiffing the server results in making the server's life harder to live.",ctsa8js,205.64939454698455,1,1438786015,64,12,1837,0,61.05863632521974,493.0,728.0,24.0,3,0.041666666666666664,0.041666666666666664,0.125,0.20833333333333334,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.041666666666666664,0.041666666666666664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08333333333333333,0.041666666666666664,0.6666666666666666,0.07991718426501035,0.22920892494929007,0.0,0,0.0,498,87.46,62.60,5.21,71.06,20.75,21.08,84.34,53.41,8.63,4.02,0.00,0.00,0.60,1.20,2.21,4.62,11.04,14.46,8.03,5.02,6.83,1.41,12.25,4.62,4.02,1.61,1.41,2.21,4.42,3.41,1.00,0.00,0.60,0.40,8.43,0.20,0.00,0.60,0.60,12.45,1.81,3.21,1.81,3.21,0.40,4.42,0.40,0.20,0.00,0.20,3.82,0.00,0.80,0.00,3.01,6.83,0.40,3.41,2.21,2.21,0.40,1.81,9.24,0.60,8.03,1.20,4.62,2.01,5.82,1.81,0.60,6.63,0.00,0.00,0.20,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.20,11.45,4.82,3.01,0.20,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.20,0.00,0.80,0.40,2.01

t3_37scpk,"this is an interesting thought, but you are basing it on a premise that aliens will be roughly on the same technological level as we are. seems more probable that either of us will be in the stone age relative to another. so, either they will not have the concept of constructed things, or our concept of robots will be on the same level as an useful sharp stick that makes animals become food. what you might look into in this area is the fermi paradox (""where is everybody?""). basically, given the vastness of the universe and the endless number of possibilities, there seems to be a significant chance of advanced alien civilizations being present; and it would surely be communicating and doing stuff on a large scale. but if so, how come we do not see any of that? some of the logical explanations actually fit the idea that all aliens might be on roughly the same level. let us say something (reapers or whatever) resets any life on certain intervals, so all civilizations had about the same start not a very long time ago. but there are other options. like, there is no aliens. or, the aliens are so different that we actually see them all the time but do not understand it. another way to look at this: we do not even know how consciousness works yet. that's the reason there is no ai (not the lack of processing power). for example, to make airplanes, people first tried to replicate birds, and failed at that. then they made something entirely unnatural based on the science of aerodynamics, and it actually worked. so, we do not have this brain science. some say there is even something beyond just mechanics involved. a soul or whatever. so who's to say it is even possible to make a true ai or digitize a person?",crpm7rq,197.35568496442298,1,1432962677,221,20,-11122,0,64.72596884984029,313.0,467.0,20.0,3,0.0,0.0,0.25,0.65,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05,0.0,0.0,0.05,0.0,1.0,0.043859649122807015,0.24600638977635783,0.0,0,0.0,313,35.88,48.72,56.92,49.56,16.47,18.21,88.50,60.38,13.74,4.15,0.00,2.56,0.64,0.00,0.96,9.58,8.31,11.18,11.50,8.63,8.31,2.88,19.49,4.15,3.51,2.24,0.32,4.15,1.92,1.60,0.32,0.00,0.00,0.32,7.03,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,21.09,3.51,2.56,0.96,7.03,2.56,7.67,2.56,1.28,0.96,0.32,0.96,0.32,0.32,0.00,0.32,6.07,2.88,1.92,1.28,0.32,0.64,1.92,14.38,2.24,11.82,0.64,7.67,3.19,1.60,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.32,0.32,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,14.70,5.43,4.47,0.32,0.32,0.96,0.00,0.00,0.64,0.64,1.92,0.00

t3_38d9or,"you have some misconceptions about research and statistics. you are conflating some statistical concepts. first of all, numerical climate models are a tool for forecasting, but they are not used as evidence for global warming. the main evidence for global warming comes from an understanding of the radiative properties of greenhouse gases, measurements of atmospheric co2 changes, the cooling of the stratosphere, land and ocean temperature records, and paleoclimate evidence (consistent fossil records like you were searching for) your claim about an expected 5% false positive rate is an honest mistake. confidence intervals are given for a particular value (say mean temperature), and are wider or narrower based on the precision of the prediction and the variability of the data. your talk about a 5% false positive rate is highly confused since false positive rate has little to do with confidence intervals. you are probably thinking of p-values, which are notoriously difficult to grasp. in some fields (all social science, for example), a 5% significance level is adopted with p-values (physics and chemistry use much lower significance levels). p-values are related to the false positive rate, but again, p-values are a very subtle concept that everyone trips up on, and i do not trust myself to explain in one post. my best definition of p-values is they are the probability of observing data at least as inconsistent with the null hypothesis as the data you collected. you see why i defer. i would check out khan academy if you want to learn more. you should also look up ""statistical power"", since that is more directly related to false positives. an important point is that if you were constructing a hypothesis test about whether global warming was happening (eg testing that global temperature has a positive trend), you would set the null hypothesis that global warming is *false*. you would then reject the null if after your analysis, you got a p-value below 5%. this link might help you understand ci's, look at figure a) [ipcc uncertainty](there are 3 main types of uncertainty in climate models. they are measurement error (related to butterfly effect), model uncertainty, and what is called ""scenario uncertainty"". this is how the nations of the world will behave (emissions, mitigation efforts, etc), and it comes to dominate the total uncertainty in the future. note that all 3 of those sources of variability lead to confidence intervals (the vertical width of the color band represents the confidence interval at that time).",crulvk1,977.3035120593186,1,1433369663,525,60,26573,0,41.87543256174834,407.0,689.0,19.0,1,0.10526315789473684,0.0,0.15789473684210525,0.2631578947368421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.10526315789473684,0.0,0.7368421052631579,0.06314307849395569,0.3046683046683047,0.0,0,0.0,420,88.00,76.97,27.33,84.54,22.11,25.71,77.86,45.71,9.05,5.71,1.19,0.00,3.81,0.00,0.71,3.33,8.10,13.81,8.33,2.86,5.24,0.48,14.29,5.00,3.10,1.19,1.90,2.62,8.57,5.95,2.62,1.43,0.24,0.48,7.38,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,18.57,4.29,2.62,2.38,5.00,4.05,2.14,3.10,1.19,0.24,1.43,0.24,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.24,6.43,0.48,2.14,3.57,2.86,0.48,1.67,9.52,1.43,12.14,1.19,7.62,3.10,2.38,0.24,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,18.57,4.52,5.24,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.43,0.95,0.24,4.29,1.90
t3_38d9or,"hello i am an earth sciences undergraduate at cambridge university, and have been studying climate change (mainly in the cenozoic) this year. i literally just sat an exam on it today. our department does not really concern itself with making predictions about anthropogenic climate change. we believe that the present is the key to the past, and vice versa. most work we do is studying palaeoclimatic events, using a suite of geochemical proxies, such as carbon-13 isotope fractionation, and benthic foraminifera mg/ca ratios, which can be measured in oceanic sediments. there is a large scale ocean drilling programme to provide samples of ancient sediment material from cores. since your third bullet point has been met, i hope that i can grab a delta for ""a good study showing that the greenhouse effect alone is enough to cause catastrophic warming (without appealing to feedback mechanisms)"". all i really need to do is show you a study of a unique past event which showed extreme warming (8 degrees), in a short amount of time which coincides with a massive release of organic carbon (proposed to be 5000gt c). the petm and other early cenozoic hyperthermals... [beyond methane: towards a theory for the paleocene?eocene thermal maximum](the paper in laymen's terms is basically: * we know there was a temporary abrupt warming of 6-8 degrees celcius 56 million years ago from previous studies (in references), e.g. an extinction of ocean bottom organisms. * ocean carbon-13 isotope ratios became very light, very quickly (10 - 30 thousand years). what could explain these observations? * a release of organic carbon into the atmosphere. methane or carbon dioxide? * 5000gtons carbon as carbon dioxide. to put it in perspective, we will soon have released about 500gtons of carbon as carbon dioxide already, far quicker than the petm. a key difference between then and now is that there were no ice caps 56 million years ago, and the planet was already hotter, by as much as 10 - 12 degrees, but still was able to warm an extra 6 degrees even so. **no ice feedbacks needed whatsoever.** the petm studies attack the climate change issue with the inverse approach of the computer models you abhor: simple chemistry. we look at past warming events, and work out how much carbon had to be released to match independent observations of isotopes. my personal conclusion from the petm, is that ice coverage is what may actually save us from catastrophic warming. without the ice caps, our climate response may be more sensitive to co2 release at current temperatures/concentration: 6 degrees warming in the petm may be achieved with far less carbon release today (a tenth?!). i do worry about us.",crumcu9,1177.8775829388837,1,1433370432,525,60,27342,0,52.18769719310714,433.0,705.0,26.0,1,0.0,0.0,0.07692307692307693,0.34615384615384615,0.0,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.038461538461538464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07692307692307693,0.0,0.5769230769230769,0.08254273504273504,0.3117782909930716,0.0,0,0.0,450,87.43,55.29,32.18,55.07,20.45,27.33,70.67,44.22,7.78,4.22,1.56,2.00,0.67,0.00,0.00,3.56,7.78,13.56,8.00,5.11,3.78,1.11,12.67,6.22,3.11,1.33,4.00,2.00,3.11,2.22,0.67,0.22,0.22,0.22,3.78,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,9.33,2.00,2.44,0.89,2.00,0.22,2.44,3.11,1.11,0.00,2.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,4.89,2.44,0.89,0.89,0.67,0.22,4.44,8.89,1.78,13.11,1.33,5.33,6.67,4.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,19.11,5.56,4.00,0.89,0.00,0.67,0.22,1.11,0.44,0.22,3.33,2.67

t3_2x9snj,"i love your idea, hate lying politicians, but there are problems to the point of making it unworkable: 1) politicians often deal in shades of grey. if i were to say ""guns make people safer"" there is a whole heck of a lot of evidence that statement is false however it is not definitive in way courts normally deal with facts. maybe guns make us more likely to be the victim of murder but less likely to be raped. maybe guns make us more likely to experience violence from fellow citizens but less likely to experience violence from the state. it is not a simple question and certainly it is very hard to prove that the politician knew it was false at the time. 2) liability. i think it is pretty clear president obama knew ""if you like your plan you can keep your plan - period"" was a lie when he said it. and while he is a relatively well off guy with a few millions or tens of millions in the bank the ""damages"" from the untruth of that statement probably run into the billions. he could not ""make things right"" to the impacted even if the court agreed with my assessment that he knew it was a lie when he said it. (and you will note that at the time the fact checkers backed him up and then changed their tune a few months later - how is the court to decide when even the contemporary ""fact checkers"" cant.) 3) what about lies that are for purely political reasons? ""i did not have sexual relations with that woman"" nearly brought bill clinton down. it was a lie, hundreds of millions were pissed off by it, it certainly impacted how he was seen, and it cost taxpayers millions and millions of dollars in government resources investigating it, yet it was a purely political lie. i am not sure it was even a fair question to be asking the man at the time and of course he was going to lie about it. the same goes for anti-gay closeted politicians. politicians lie to be appealing to voters because it is hard to both be interested in politics and the kind of people that the voters of your district would be happy to elect. how do we deal with that? 4) how do we stop every politician from endlessly spending all of their time and money in court defending themselves? all this litigation would be very expensive and it could result in only very wealthy people being financially able to go into politics. ultimately the recourse of voters is at the ballot box if they do not like a politician. sadly a lot of people seem unable to evaluate whether statements are true or false and simply accept what politicians say at face value. not sure there is a solution to that one thought.",coy82vm,157.77690995395153,1,1424985561,20,7,2725,0,62.83746671738305,478.0,689.0,22.0,22,0.0,0.0,0.22727272727272727,0.3181818181818182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13636363636363635,0.0,0.6818181818181818,0.02950523643800955,0.25313807531380755,0.0,0,0.0,481,63.71,65.37,13.37,40.75,21.86,16.84,89.81,55.09,12.89,6.03,1.25,0.83,1.46,1.66,0.83,6.86,7.48,13.31,9.15,6.24,6.65,1.46,15.18,6.44,1.46,2.08,2.49,2.70,6.65,3.74,2.91,0.00,1.25,0.21,8.52,0.00,0.42,0.21,2.29,17.67,4.16,2.91,2.29,4.57,3.33,3.74,2.49,0.62,1.04,0.42,1.25,0.42,0.00,0.62,0.00,7.07,1.25,1.04,3.74,0.00,1.04,3.95,8.73,1.04,9.15,1.25,4.78,3.12,3.95,0.42,0.21,2.08,0.00,0.21,0.62,0.42,0.00,0.00,0.21,0.00,10.40,3.95,1.25,0.21,0.00,0.62,0.00,0.62,2.49,0.00,1.25,0.00

t3_2w51ti,"i think there is an obvious philosophical argument to be had about the rights of women. it has been done better by other people. i am going to make a point about public health. people want to control when they have kids. the primary reason why people have sex is not to have kids. and if that comes up as a surprise it can be a terrifying shock. the choice to have an abortion often does not really feel like a choice in someone's panic. that's why when abortion was illegal people went great distances to get them. doctor's would tell women to rinse with lye and soap vigorously. people used copper coat hangers. and women died. you do not want people doing complicated procedures like this at home with no supervision and training. so from a practical public health viewpoint, it has to be legal. legally, it is even more complicated. do you want women who receive abortions to receive life in prison? when abortion was illegal in canada, a few doctors began doing the procedure and courts didn't know how to prosecute. it becomes even harder when you talk about spontaneous or life-saving abortions. legal questions about abortions can result in women dying from pregnancy complications because abortion laws are not clear. that's unacceptable. there's also the question of what life is. i really do not think a zygote is a human life any more than a sperm cell is. you may see this differently because of your background. but the legal and public health concerns are the practical reality that means abortion has to be legal. if this upsets you, i would suggest not going to route of making abortion illegal. i would rather suggest that you support improving foster care, access to contraception, sexual education, and maternal support systems. if people are educated and supported, fewer abortions will happen and the quality of life for everyone will increase.",conqpc0,323.5386658152546,1,1424141799,116,24,7236,0,64.21182035355949,322.0,495.0,26.0,0,0.038461538461538464,0.0,0.07692307692307693,0.15384615384615385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2692307692307693,0.04904761904761904,0.27639751552795033,0.0,0,0.0,323,44.04,68.98,17.87,42.63,12.42,20.43,90.40,52.94,9.91,4.33,1.55,0.00,2.17,0.00,0.62,5.57,5.88,11.76,13.93,6.50,7.43,2.48,21.05,4.95,2.79,2.79,0.00,1.55,4.64,2.79,1.86,0.93,0.31,0.00,12.38,0.62,0.00,1.86,0.00,17.34,4.64,3.41,3.10,3.10,0.93,5.57,1.24,0.62,0.00,0.62,7.12,0.00,6.50,4.02,0.00,4.33,0.00,0.62,2.79,1.24,0.00,3.41,15.48,1.55,6.81,2.17,2.79,2.48,3.10,0.00,0.31,0.31,0.00,0.62,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,12.69,7.74,2.48,0.00,0.00,0.31,0.00,0.31,0.00,1.86,0.00,0.00

t3_3f9ma6,"argument 1 is a common fallacy when discussing surveillance in general. it has several valid counterarguments: * the more data the company collects, the more you are at risk getting your data leaked. no system is 100% secure, and we occasionally see high profile cyberattacks leaking personal data. for example the sony breach a few years back, and a few years ago the danish driver license database at the police was broken into leaking personal information. this can cause nasty consequences like fraud and identity theft. the more data is collected the bigger the risk. * another argument in conjunction with argument 2 is that data is sometimes misinterpreted. you might have nothing to hide, but false positives can happen with unpleasant consequences. for example a few years ago there was a story in denmark where a random danish citizen was forbidden to enter usa for unknown reason. it was discovered that his new phone number coincidentally was identical to the number a terrorist suspect used to have, but the systems weren't up to date. to this day he still can't go to usa. * psychologically stuff happens in your brain when you are aware you are being ""watched"", whether it is a surveillance camera on the streets or surfing the internet. people change behaviour and are slightly more stressful.",ctmmnvt,164.74513191461332,1,1438341405,30,5,-17870,0,47.808781452192704,214.0,360.0,13.0,1,0.0,0.0,0.23076923076923078,0.23076923076923078,0.07692307692307693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15384615384615385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6923076923076924,0.044642857142857144,0.35046728971962615,0.0,0,0.0,217,80.83,79.65,39.18,1.00,16.69,25.81,79.26,46.54,8.29,4.15,0.00,0.46,2.76,0.92,0.00,4.15,9.68,10.14,10.60,2.76,4.61,1.84,13.82,9.22,3.23,1.84,1.38,4.15,6.45,0.92,4.61,1.84,1.84,0.00,9.68,0.00,0.46,0.00,0.92,10.60,2.30,2.76,0.00,2.76,0.92,2.76,1.38,0.92,0.46,0.00,0.46,0.46,0.00,0.00,0.00,6.91,0.46,0.00,2.76,0.92,2.76,4.61,9.68,0.46,15.21,2.30,6.45,6.45,1.38,0.92,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,12.90,5.99,2.76,0.46,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.92,0.92,0.00,1.84

t3_35k9i9,"i think the biggest issue with the response ""not all [insert noun here] are like that..."", which i have been guilty of using before when i feel i have been associated wrongly, is that as a phrase it acts as a dismissive and without quantifying the issue. many stereotypes have some basis in a common trend found in reality, and when having a discussion it's, i feel, just as harmful to say ""all x are like this"" as it is to say ""not all x are like this"". the former implies that every single member of a group acts a certain way, and the latter implies that almost no member of the group acts that way. when i say ""not all men are like that"" i am suggesting that most men are not like that. and both sides are equally devoid of any real factual quantifiable value. when it comes to discussions of human rights like this, and equality, it is very easily for a conversation to become so heated with emotional tension that it loses objectivity. without being able to put hard statistics towards a goal (e.g. ""% of men who are abusive in their relationships"", ""% of women who've committed rape"", ""what the wage gap actually is"") it is very easy to just go with a gut feeling and wave a banner without any actual solid ground to stand on. and the most difficult thing is, because these questions are so political and there is so much riding on them, the numbers are very inaccurate, lack precision, are very prone to skew, and can vary wildly in interpretation depending on the context. **tldr; saying ""not all x are like this"" implies that it is a minority of x who are like this. it dismisses the issue and minimizes it, without ever quantifying any objective numbers to support the notion. the argument is purely emotionally defensive.**",cr5buw4,504.5984212600437,1,1431363072,171,8,16489,0,60.18607142857145,315.0,461.0,14.0,44,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21428571428571427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21428571428571427,0.019536019536019536,0.2698412698412698,0.0,0,0.0,315,61.24,44.96,22.71,5.47,28.64,17.46,85.40,55.87,12.70,2.86,2.22,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.63,9.84,7.62,14.60,10.16,5.71,6.98,3.17,15.56,6.67,6.03,2.54,0.32,6.35,5.08,1.59,3.49,0.63,0.95,0.32,7.30,0.00,0.00,0.32,0.95,14.92,2.54,2.54,0.32,3.17,3.81,3.17,2.54,0.00,1.27,1.27,0.63,0.32,0.00,0.32,0.00,4.13,1.90,0.95,0.63,0.32,0.95,1.27,12.70,0.00,8.89,1.59,4.76,2.22,1.27,0.00,0.00,0.32,0.00,0.00,0.32,0.00,0.32,0.00,0.00,0.00,19.37,5.08,5.08,0.00,0.32,0.00,0.00,0.00,5.08,0.63,0.63,2.54

t3_3enur5,"let?s start with your framing position! to begin with, jesus? pre-incarnate status as divine is (based on the biblical text) poorly understood at best (although john certainly though he pre-existed). positions have been argued most vehemently both ways, but his pre-incarnate state is, to us, basically opaque. i?ll not take a position here, except to say that the way you framed this question would have to be considered pretty speculative. let?s work with what?s recorded, instead! to talk about jesus? sacrifice and why it might be important, you?d have to talk about who he is, and what he represents. you?ve alluded to this in your question, but what do we mean when we say jesus is the lamb of god, and why does that matter? jesus is the messiah; that is, he is god?s anointed (in the same way as saul, david, and solomon) to be god?s king and representative to the jews. there had been many, many other anointed in the past; every king of israel was messiah. jesus was claiming that office. the miracles of jesus? ministry are in part signifiers of his credentials. that is, he?s demonstrating that he actually is sent on god?s authority. the difference here is that jesus is pushing for an expanded understanding of god, his law, and his kingdom. jesus in the gospels is claiming to be the king who is prophesied to usher in god?s kingdom and begin the rule of god on earth. his claims and stance, coupled with the miraculous signs like healing, caused a high degree of polarization in the contemporary jewish community. that said, let?s take another look at your framing question, as it seems to be the foundation of your perspective. as you?ve set it up, it kind of sounds like jesus is saying ?heigh ho, better pop off to earth for a spot of the old redemption, what? oops, pesky humans, with their crucifying! well, back to eternity; at least the blighters have a chance now.? instead, let?s take the text at face value and look at it as jesus is recorded to have done. this is a man who should have been treated like what he was, a prophet of god, a king and messiah, and the representative of god to man. if those things are true (and we?re assuming they are for this argument), then respect and devotion are certainly appropriate responses. jesus? entire ministry is him pushing people to a clearer understanding and a refined relationship with the god of abraham, isaac, and jacob. this would all have been well within the understanding and history of the contemporary jewish culture jesus was in. there?s even precedent in the prophets for what jesus was doing. now, it seems clear that jesus himself knew that he would be killed. he alludes to it throughout the gospels (i shall raise this temple in 3 days, etc.). when we get the garden of gethsemane, however, jesus is incredibly stressed. he clearly does not want to be crucified, to the point where he is sweating blood. this is where we can answer your question with more accuracy. jesus is not doing this because he wants to or because it?s easy. in fact, in the text, he?s not even doing it to save humanity. in matthew 26:39, he asks not to be killed, and says that he does this because it?s the father?s will. so, whatever jesus? pre-incarnate state, whatever else he might have done, however the kingdom might have manifested with his continued survival, in christ?s crucifixion we can understand the term lamb of god. this is a reference to the lamb of the passover, the sacrifice whose blood on the lintel will signify your obedience to the lord, and thereby spare you from death. it?s a reference to the exodus, and god?s salvation of the israelites from bondage. in the same way, jesus? sacrifice frees us from the bondage and slavery of sin. the merit in the sacrifice is that jesus, so far the only human being who lived as god intended (that is, without sin and prioritizing god?s will), is brutally executed *while doing god?s will*. his life and the manner of his death signify and confirm his authority from god, and that empowers him to be our representative, at once satisfying to god as doing as an actual human ought, and understandable to us because he?s from our context. just to reiterate, in the scripture jesus is acting like a human. there are things he doesn?t know. the power he uses is from god. he?s scared at the prospect of his execution. these are not the traits of an aloof divine being going through the motions. for jesus, it?s not a sacrifice of no value, but a protracted and painful (and humiliating) death. the next logical question is to ask why a sacrifice is necessary at all, and that?s a tougher one to answer. from the old to new testaments, sacrifice and death are always used to redeem sin. my understanding is that it?s an illustration of the seriousness of sin and its consequences, but i?d understand if that answer failed to satisfy. anyway, hope that helps. i really rushed through this; there have been books and books written on this subject. if anything was unclear or you?d like more info, i?m happy to expand on any details. tl;dr: jesus wasn?t a detached divine being, according to the text. his sacrifice was at great personal cost. he was god?s representative and rightful king of israel (indeed, all the world), and therefore should have been treated as such rather than being wrongfully executed. his perspective was not one of giving away 30+ years out of a million billion, but rather one of being god?s faithful servant within a limited human lifetime. the merit in his sacrifice is that he did god?s will in his life to the point of unfair death at the hands of those he came to help, and that makes his sacrifice sufficient to repair our relationship with god, from god?s perspective.",ctgrxoh,1682.5978769512603,1,1437957098,44,10,6879,0,64.06162528963921,1007.0,1486.0,57.0,1,0.017543859649122806,0.017543859649122806,0.19298245614035087,0.42105263157894735,0.0,0.0,0.03508771929824561,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017543859649122806,0.05263157894736842,0.07017543859649122,0.0,0.8245614035087718,0.06412283153354582,0.22045680238331677,0.0,0,0.0,1054,70.64,79.28,3.56,48.67,18.82,18.50,84.63,55.50,13.28,6.93,0.57,1.14,1.14,3.89,0.19,6.36,7.50,14.71,10.63,3.89,6.36,0.95,14.52,3.42,2.37,1.90,0.95,1.42,4.55,2.85,1.61,0.28,0.57,0.09,10.63,0.09,0.00,0.00,4.65,10.91,2.85,1.61,1.33,2.28,1.42,3.23,1.04,0.28,0.57,0.19,1.04,0.47,0.57,0.00,0.00,7.02,1.61,0.76,4.55,0.66,0.19,2.66,9.11,1.33,8.73,0.66,5.79,2.37,0.85,0.28,0.09,0.19,7.97,1.04,0.38,0.00,0.00,0.09,0.19,0.09,14.99,4.93,6.74,0.19,0.47,0.19,0.28,0.38,0.00,0.00,1.52,0.28

t3_2wc5yt,">in my opinion, there is no ""meaningful"" reason to attempt an expedition on everest other than ""because it is there."" do you believe that the same is true of other mountains as well, or just everest in particular? if you are willing to acknowledge that there is ever a ""meaningful"" reason to climb any difficult mountain aside from ""because it is there,"" then i think you would have to allow for the possibility that someone could have a meaningful reason to do so on everest, as it is simply another very high and difficult climb (and significantly less difficult and dangerous than many other peaks). i think it is important to remember that just because you find something distasteful, unpleasant, unappealing, or lacking in value, does not mean that it is inherently so. it just means you do not find it tasteful, pleasant, appealing or valuable. there are very likely activities you engage in that others would find disturbing or bothersome, but that does not mean that for you they are not a source of satisfaction and meaning in your life. in terms of the sherpas, i have actually done many years of work with indigenous populations in some of the absolute poorest places in the u.s. and i can tell you that while it may seem exploitative, for instance, for native americans to sell drums, pipe bags, feathers, and other trinkets to tourists (because it is both perpetuates misrepresentations of their actual culture and because it exploits and takes advantage of spiritual traditions which have already been significant casualties of war), surprisingly most of the people i have spoken to would still rather not have that small source of income disappear. i find myself wondering if this is not also the case (although arguably to a much greater degree) for those sherpas who, if not for the income related to acting as guides, might find themselves displaced entirely, losing what is left of their way of life. should they not at least be allowed the option about whether or not they choose to participate in a risky endeavor in order to preserve their way of life? climbing everest is still dangerous of course, but it is not as dangerous as it once was. it has gone from being an almost certain death sentence to something that is relatively safe, when compared to some of the other 8000 meter peaks. i have not looked to see the recent statistics, so someone who has more time could probably quote them more accurately than i, but i believe we are talking about one death in hundreds of climbers as opposed to the initial years, during which it claimed virtually everyone who attempted it. in terms of the trash and waste left on the mountain. you are absolutely right. that is a travesty even for those of us who will never climb it and one that needs significant correction. that correction however does not necessarily mean that your first point (that climbing everest is pointless) is true. nor does it mean that there are only two mutually exclusive options (that everest must either not be climbed or it will be a dumping ground for trash and refuse). other possible solutions exist that can address that problem without eliminating climbing the mountain as an option. the problem, of course, is that the measure of worth you ascribe to scaling the mountain is not necessarily reflective of it is actual value (which would be difficult to measure objectively, especially given that what drives each individual to do it might vary from individual to individual) and therefore weighing that against the damage to the mountain is not really possible. what i think we can agree on is that the damage to the mountain is unacceptable and that regardless of why people choose to climb it, this is the underlying issue, not the inherent worth of the activity. i am uncomfortable with regulating people's choices simply because i do not see the value of those choices, but i think in this case the relevant factor is that people's individual choices are affecting something (the condition of the mountain) which belongs to more than just those who choose to climb it. i would argue however, that the preservation of the mountain and the experiences of the climbers can both be accomplished without assuming that only one or the other is possible.",copid03,1247.6121958065542,1,1424287781,54,16,3223,0,44.12340163934428,732.0,1140.0,24.0,10,0.08333333333333333,0.041666666666666664,0.375,0.7083333333333334,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.08333333333333333,0.125,0.0,0.08333333333333333,0.0,0.08333333333333333,0.08333333333333333,0.0,1.7083333333333333,NaN,0.20901639344262296,0.0,0,0.0,733,40.48,34.61,50.06,14.47,33.32,24.56,88.95,60.71,16.78,5.32,2.18,0.41,1.64,0.00,1.09,11.46,6.00,13.78,10.78,5.87,7.23,3.00,15.42,6.00,3.27,2.05,1.09,2.46,5.59,2.32,3.14,0.41,0.55,0.14,6.68,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,21.96,5.18,2.46,2.46,5.18,2.18,7.50,0.82,0.55,0.14,0.00,0.55,0.00,0.41,0.00,0.14,6.68,0.68,2.46,1.64,0.41,1.77,1.50,12.01,0.82,8.59,1.91,4.23,2.32,0.95,0.14,0.14,0.82,0.14,0.55,0.41,0.00,0.00,0.27,0.14,0.00,11.19,3.00,4.50,0.00,0.00,0.27,0.00,0.00,1.09,0.27,1.91,0.14

t3_3gu6gx,"one of your points against all-party-consent seems to be it is not consistent with how we handle private written communications. i believe it is consistent, in a sense. written communications allow one party to reveal the contents of the communication, to some third party (including law enforcement)... and that makes the sender liable for things he said. this makes it seem like written communications effectively have no expectation of privacy. but they do - [the message is considered private while ""in transit""](the government may not intercept a letter and read it before it is been delivered to you, even if the recipient says ""you have my full permission to read any letters sent to me"". the sender is protected until the recipient gets the letter. he expects the post office (or in the case of email, the isp) to keep his communications private until they are delivered. once the letter is delivered, the theory is that the sender no longer can reasonably expect privacy because the letter is completely out of their control. the recipient has a physical written thing they can show to anyone they want, and with email they have a computer file stored somewhere on their computer (which is again out of the sender's control). with verbal communications, the expectation is that it is private because the sender is not providing anyone with either a physical object or a digital file. they expect privacy because they believe their words disappear as soon as they are done transferring over the wire. and as with letters, the recipient can't volunteer to have the sender's words intercepted in-transit (aka a wiretap), without a warrant and probable cause. so the distinction is - if i provide you with a physical letter or a digital file, i am providing something that i cannot reasonably expect to control after you receive it. but if i talk to you, i am not providing you with anything physical, or a computer file... i am just making soundwaves that travel via air or wire and then disappear. you can record those soundwaves, but i never voluntarily provided *the recording*. the recording is something you created and has some of the same issues as hearsay evidence (it's difficult to prove who spoke the words, that the recording is accurate, that it was not entirely fabricated from a similar sounding voice, etc.) i believe that's the legal justification behind 2-party consent. also, voiceprint analysis (where you record a voice and then an expert uses software to prove it belongs to one specific person and nobody else) has been rejected before in court and is not treated as reliable as, say, a fingerprint... it can be submitted with other evidence to make a case, but i do not believe it can be used as the sole piece of evidence to convict someone.",cu1q7z5,319.23831998507006,1,1439487320,147,19,18689,0,47.56044585987263,471.0,760.0,21.0,2,0.14285714285714285,0.0,0.19047619047619047,0.09523809523809523,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047619047619047616,0.0,0.0,0.047619047619047616,0.0,0.19047619047619047,0.0,0.7142857142857142,0.0726082251082251,0.21868365180467092,0.0,0,0.0,476,62.70,70.04,30.01,36.89,22.67,25.21,88.03,57.35,15.13,7.77,2.52,0.21,2.10,0.63,2.31,7.14,9.87,12.82,9.66,2.52,8.40,2.94,15.34,4.83,3.15,0.84,1.26,1.47,1.47,1.05,0.42,0.00,0.00,0.21,14.08,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.63,18.49,3.99,4.20,2.10,4.83,1.89,5.67,3.36,0.84,2.10,0.21,1.05,0.21,0.84,0.00,0.00,5.88,2.73,0.21,2.31,0.21,0.42,2.94,13.03,2.10,8.40,2.31,3.36,2.73,3.15,1.68,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,16.60,5.67,4.20,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.26,0.84,1.05,2.73,0.84

t3_3dj5zp,"marriages ending are not attempting to penalize people, most of the typical ""downsides"" are actually benefits if you look at them in context. yes, it sucks that you sometimes need to use the legal system to split your properties in half, but on the plus side, you have a system to ensure you can at least get half of the things the two of you owned as a couple. there are way's that this can be done without marriage at this point of course, but they still hold the same ""drawbacks"". another huge benefit is custody rights. the argument of ""letting yourself go"" has nothing to do with actually getting married. it has to do with being around someone and not having feeling a strong pressure to find someone to be with. this happens with or without marriage, and its really down to the couple to handle that. > secondly, i have seen in many cases where there is just no repairing the relationship, yet the couple remains together due to the financial repercussions of ending their failed marriage. this ultimately leads to a very uncomfortable situation at home, especially for children. it also in many cases leads to infidelity which brings a plethora of problems itself. the big issue here is that the alternative is much worse. this is usually about the person who has a larger income feeling they deserve more of the assets after the divorce, and not wanting to give that up. yes, it can really suck, but imagine if assets were not split? especially if there are children involved, things can get very complicated. imagine a situation with one stay at home parent, and one employed parent. the couple made this decision because it made sense at the time, but now they are unhappy and wish to divorce. the stay at home parent has very few technical skills from not being a part of the work force, is the primary caretaker of the child and would likely have custody, and if they were not entitled to any of the assets that the employed parent had, they would really have nothing, despite that they were operating and working as a team. and yes, i am aware that legal fee's are quite high, and that's really the biggest issue. that being said, the legal protection is what makes a marriage a risk more safe. i would be less willing to share a bank account, and all of my possessions with another person if there was not any form of legal protection in place to help deal with that.",ct5ndqg,472.88941411643583,1,1437075557,29,12,1192,0,63.22784883720932,430.0,619.0,20.0,11,0.05,0.0,0.3,0.5,0.0,0.1,0.0,0.1,0.05,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.1,0.03571428571428572,0.23255813953488372,0.0,0,0.0,430,68.58,54.63,26.37,13.24,21.50,19.30,90.70,59.07,12.09,4.42,0.93,0.00,1.63,0.00,1.86,7.67,8.84,14.88,10.47,6.05,6.05,2.79,15.35,4.65,2.79,0.93,1.16,4.42,3.95,1.40,2.33,0.70,0.70,0.47,10.47,2.79,0.00,0.00,0.00,15.35,2.09,1.86,2.79,3.26,1.16,6.74,1.40,0.47,0.23,0.47,0.23,0.00,0.23,0.00,0.00,10.93,3.49,1.63,3.95,1.63,1.63,2.33,11.86,0.23,10.23,1.40,6.98,2.33,4.42,0.23,0.70,0.93,0.00,0.00,1.16,0.47,0.00,0.70,0.00,0.00,12.33,4.42,5.35,0.00,0.00,0.23,0.00,0.00,1.40,0.70,0.00,0.23

t3_3hi93w,"the sensation you are feeling is called angst and it is usually transient. you say you do not want anyone's sympathy or empathy, but most of your op is not an apparent request for either of those; rather, you just list all the reasons you hate things others care about or characteristics they have. you include yourself in the title but there is no self-examination or criticism in the post, which suggests that deep down you actually think highly of yourself compared to others. it follows that your frustration is rooted in the dissonance between how great you think you are and how little the world seems to either acknowledge that or provide you with the success you want. >we are all slaves to enlightened self-interest. no act of kindness is genuine. this requires that you make an assumption of motive before the fact and deliberately disregard any conflicting evidence. people die for each other, people sacrifice when there is no hope of reward and people do the right thing even in societies that punish them for it. holding your view requires you to ignore all of these based on an unfounded, unsupported assumption that disregards most philosophical discussion of ethics and morality that has ever happened. now, this may be true of *you*. if this is how you view altruistic actions and choose to project your own internal dialogue on everyone else, that's unfair to them. also, maybe think about your own ethical reasoning and make your peace with why *you* do the things you do. >i hate everyone who identifies with a nation, religion, or other group. ...but everyone does this. it is impossible not to; you were raised in a family group and/or culture that imparted particular values and standards of ethical behavior that you would otherwise have no good reason to follow. you were taught a language and a history that, deep down, you will always think of as more *yours* than those of others. that you do not make ostentatious gestures towards your culture does not make you special, superior or enlightened. this is true of literally everyone raised by another living being. >i hate everyone who has their country's accent. i hate everyone who speaks with the same language intonation as the rest of their country. to be brutally honest, this sounds petulant and silly. most people find language useful and rewarding for all the reasons you seem to dislike it. just get better at talking to people. then you develop relationships and relationships are rewarding. all good things require work. >people are motivated by sh*t that's gone on before anyone was born and this is so stupid! remember that culture we talked about? that culture and the identity it gave you are all the product of one branch of history. if you want to understand why you are the way you are, why other people think things about you without ever having met you, why other cultures have different values...then you study history. maybe you do not like history class, but it would be impossible for you to exist as you are without history and to understand yourself and others without understanding history. put another way: history is a giant chain of cause and effect that brings us to where we are. there is no escaping it, but understanding it can be rewarding and informative. >jobs are boring. were you expecting life to be an endless tidal wave of joy?

what country do you live in and how has capitalism hurt you (as you use a computer to access the internet)? to be brutally honest once again: it seems that you actually have a very high opinion of yourself and a very skewed perspective on what life ought to be. all of your criticisms of...the rest of humanity, i guess?...only hold water if we presume that the world ought to be a place where: 1) a world where nobody cared what anyone else did to anyone else (thereby making altruism without any hope of social reward possible), 2) a world where people somehow developed an identity independent of any influence...somehow finding a language and a mutually agreed-upon set of values without violating 1). 3) a world where we were either totally isolated from one another or communicated perfectly. 4) a world where you were somehow provided for absent any actual work on your part or where all work was exciting and fun and somehow that never became the norm we adapted to. 5) a world where you had an outlet to say and do whatever you wanted without consequence. not to go full freud (or jung?) but...it kinda sounds like a return to the womb. i mean...no social interaction, all needs provided for, no responsibility or accountability or need to actually *do* anything. i honestly do not know what that means. **but you say you want pragmatism**, so here is the reason you ought to change your view: humans are social creatures. we do not do well alone; even the most antisocial of us tend to go completely nutbars when they are truly isolated. the most rewarding things life offers come from interacting with other people. but people are perceptive and they can usually identify the veiled contempt you appear to have for them, so keeping this view will make everyone (who is not altruistic) avoid meaningful contact with you. you will miss out on the benefits of friendship, love, meaningful accomplishment and family. you may also become completely incompatible with society and end up in a cave with no internet. if you want a more rewarding life, learn to forget this stuff and start liking people. you will be happier, i promise.",cu7np0a,1201.7703314241483,1,1439945123,14,5,4451,0,61.99201123639344,1083.0,1656.0,71.0,90,0.056338028169014086,0.014084507042253521,0.14084507042253522,0.352112676056338,0.0,0.0,0.014084507042253521,0.0,0.028169014084507043,0.0,0.0,0.014084507042253521,0.028169014084507043,0.0,0.6478873239436618,NaN,0.23084025854108955,0.0,0,0.0,1101,32.66,90.59,37.97,63.66,17.48,20.53,91.92,58.22,18.17,9.45,0.91,1.09,6.54,0.00,0.91,8.72,5.54,11.81,9.63,6.09,7.36,2.91,16.71,4.90,2.45,2.72,0.82,2.82,7.27,4.63,2.63,0.18,1.27,0.45,15.53,0.18,0.18,0.00,0.00,20.71,4.90,3.09,2.18,5.18,2.82,6.18,1.54,0.45,0.64,0.27,1.09,0.27,0.54,0.09,0.09,6.90,2.72,1.82,1.09,1.91,0.36,2.36,13.53,1.00,9.36,1.45,5.45,2.45,2.36,0.36,0.18,0.09,0.36,0.09,0.36,0.00,0.18,0.00,0.18,0.00,15.17,7.36,2.63,0.36,0.27,0.54,0.09,0.36,0.00,0.36,1.27,1.91

[one study](found that 70% said they were happier having transitioned, as opposed to 2% who did not; 63% had thought about or attempted suicide more before transitioning than after (only 3% said they thought about it more after). [another](found that on a test designed to measure distress, ""significant decreases were found in the subscales such as anxiety, depression, interpersonal sensitivity, and hostility."" [another](found that the relief was so profound as to be measurable directly through stress hormone levels in the blood. [yet another](found decreases in anxiety from 61% to 33% and in depression from 31% to 8% pre- to post-transition. so your notion that regrets are common is simply unfounded and in fact the exact opposite of the truth. >>this is not the case for (for instance) bdd sufferers - see the links above. if the offending part is removed or modified (e.g., dermatological treatments to get rid of a mole), they simply re-fixate on a new part. trans people, in general, do not. the linked comment addresses everything you have asked. you can also go to /r/asktransgender to talk to actual trans people. they have put together many links detailing this too.",csj5cco,523.8529610421807,1,1435302092,40,6,-23121,0,41.12844914663884,638.0,1114.0,36.0,24,0.1388888888888889,0.027777777777777776,0.05555555555555555,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.027777777777777776,0.027777777777777776,0.08333333333333333,0.05555555555555555,0.027777777777777776,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.0,0.0,0.8333333333333335,NaN,0.30094043887147337,0.0,0,0.0,662,76.09,67.47,31.61,23.41,22.07,28.10,80.82,48.79,9.37,4.23,0.76,1.06,0.60,0.00,1.81,5.14,6.50,14.65,6.95,6.04,7.85,1.51,11.63,6.50,4.53,1.36,1.81,2.57,4.08,1.96,2.11,0.60,0.45,0.76,9.21,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,14.35,4.83,3.02,0.76,2.27,1.36,4.08,2.42,0.91,0.45,0.91,5.29,1.06,2.42,1.36,0.00,4.38,1.51,0.76,1.81,0.15,0.15,2.57,8.16,0.15,9.21,1.21,4.98,2.57,2.11,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.15,0.60,0.00,0.15,0.15,0.30,0.00,23.72,5.14,4.68,0.45,0.15,0.30,0.00,1.36,0.60,0.60,3.63,6.80

t3_2zlzlv,"obviously, it is going to be hard to counter the 9/10 you cite. certainly my own experience shows it to be a significant, but far lower percentage. but let me tackle a few of these. **crackers, salt, sugar, sticky things over the table or on the floor** a large number of your points cover these. in theory, most restaurants wipe down the table between guests. whether it is the breadcrumbs i have left, or stuff that fell of my plate, there is usually some debris (and even if there isn't, i am hoping you are still going to wipe down the table). for most items, really, how much harder is it pick up some extra salt? if i brought my own wet wipes, you would need to throw them away, which is probably as much work as making an extra pass with your washrag. as for stuff like, say, syrup or ketchup that spills, some of that is inevitable for a kid eating. i am not talking about purposely letting them draw on the table in ketchup and mustard, but normal kid eating. assuming your restaurant had a kid's menu, the expectation was that they would be serving kids, and a reasonable amount of sticky is just part of the package that your management decided was worth dealing with to get parents through the door. to put it another way, i do not bring wet wipes with me when i eat in a restaurant, even if there is a chance that i will drop a pat of butter, or that a ketchup-covered fry might fall off my plate. i consider that part of the expected service. and as another poster mentioned, most restaurants do not want customers getting up to grab a rag or a sweeper to do it themselves. **running around the restaurant** absolutely not cool if the parents know it is happening. but at some point, kids need to learn to self regulate. there were times when my kids were younger that they wanted to go the to bathroom. i would tell them to walk, and watch them on the way there, but, being kids, by the time they were finished, they completely forgot about the walking. if i caught them running, i would scold them, but sometimes they would forget. i know it seems obnoxious to inflict them upon others as a learning opportunity, but, honestly, there are not a lot of other situations i can think of where this same skill is studied. in most public places, you do not want to leave your kid unattended at all. at home it does not apply. a restaurant is a public-but-closed environment. **crying** ok, this sucks. i can tell you that as much as it sucks to hear someone else's baby, it is worse if it is your own. you do not get used to it - you get to be embarrassed by the public humiliation, guilty that you can't fix what is wrong, and as frustrated as everyone else that there is a baby crying. i do not in any way support just letting a baby cry and cry in a restaurant. usually when i have seen it, the parent is desperately trying to shut the kid up - giving them a bottle, rocking them, feeding them (messy) crackers - anything. many parents will try to take them to the waiting area if there is room. but you are in a tough space. you just ordered all this food, and what do you do if you can't shut the kid up? wait outside (if the weather lets you) while the rest of your family eats? all you wanted was a decent meal that you didn't have to make. again, i am not excusing it, just explaining it. you have no idea how much the parent is just hoping, hoping that the kid will settle down so they can eat. so, they may keep trying longer than they should, out of near desperation. now, there are parents who are complete selfish assholes. but most are just doing the best they can.",cpk93ep,1296.8603809040794,1,1426799928,38,8,7139,0,74.81872936206497,679.0,914.0,38.0,130,0.02631578947368421,0.0,0.3157894736842105,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.0,0.0,0.02631578947368421,0.02631578947368421,0.0,0.9473684210526314,0.05892155892155892,0.23269513991163476,0.0,0,0.0,684,43.87,62.62,41.67,12.27,18.00,14.04,91.23,59.36,17.25,10.09,3.51,0.15,3.36,0.00,3.07,7.16,7.31,12.57,10.38,5.41,7.31,2.19,21.05,5.26,3.36,1.61,0.29,4.09,4.68,1.75,2.78,0.73,0.88,0.73,12.28,1.46,0.15,0.00,0.00,16.67,1.75,1.17,3.80,6.29,1.46,6.43,2.34,0.44,0.29,0.88,3.07,0.15,0.00,0.00,2.92,6.29,1.17,1.17,3.07,1.02,0.29,2.92,13.45,1.75,11.84,2.49,7.02,2.34,1.32,1.61,0.88,0.29,0.00,0.00,0.88,0.44,0.00,0.44,0.00,0.00,17.25,5.12,7.16,0.00,0.00,0.44,0.00,0.88,0.00,0.88,0.88,1.90

(some) people pick soda because they like it, and it gives them a modicum of pleasure. disallowing it really serves no useful purpose other than to punish them arbitrarily. it's not your job (or your right) to be their parent. it is only your responsibility to treat them with the respect and dignity due all human beings.",ctkdpuw,247.9421723683767,1,1438189227,483,37,2688,0,63.35131806930693,202.0,312.0,16.0,126,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0625,0.0,0.0,0.0625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.125,0.06796296296296296,0.26732673267326734,0.0,0,0.0,202,39.41,82.66,10.18,94.25,16.83,20.30,88.12,54.46,15.84,9.41,0.50,0.50,3.47,0.00,4.95,6.44,3.96,12.38,7.92,7.92,6.93,1.98,12.38,3.96,1.98,0.99,0.00,3.47,5.45,4.95,0.50,0.00,0.50,0.00,14.85,0.50,0.00,0.00,0.00,19.31,3.47,3.96,1.49,5.45,0.50,6.93,0.50,0.00,0.00,0.00,6.44,0.00,1.98,0.00,4.46,4.46,0.99,0.99,1.98,0.00,0.50,0.50,9.90,0.99,3.96,0.50,2.48,0.99,0.99,0.00,0.00,0.50,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,19.80,7.92,3.96,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.99,3.96,2.97
t3_2uudze,"the issues come from when ""gamer"" is used as misnomer. what is being abbreviated and conflated is the terms ""casual or simple games player"" and ""hardcore or enthusiast games player"". there are exceptions and middle grounds to those two categories but most game players and the games that they play will try to appeal to one end or the other of the spectrum. casual played games: a casual gamer spends most of their time playing games that might be considered simple. they might have few games or most of their game library have elements in common. these games usually have more than one of the following: * non-complex rules and conditions to advance(matching or moving tiles, sequencing cards, etc). * lack of variations in levels or items(4 colors of tiles, a few simple bonus tiles or powerups). * very often they require a lack of in-depth thought or strategy(or they break down the pieces to solving a more complex puzzle into very small and simple steps that are easy to advance). * static backgrounds or very limited interactivity with the environment, or no environment at all. * less development time involved to create the game an example would a click and search game with a static background and you spend your time with the mouse clicking a button until all items are found, then you repeat with a different scene. in this case it has many static background, but lacks variation in gameplay, is a very simple and non-complex rule, and the development time can be done in hours to days where you just mark areas in images to respond to when clicked. enthusiast or hardcore: the games are usually the opposite of what was listed above, and may have a huge amount of items and each one with many or highly varied properties, require strategy, a great deal of development time with large teams, varied and expansive environments that usually can be explored, complex puzzles that require a lot of time and the steps are not always small. in this case unlike the casual/simple games player it is worthy to expand on what sets enthusiast apart. some features they may have one or more of the following: * large investments of money into hardware and peripherals * large investments of money into building a game library * large investments of time or money acquiring game items or building or working with in game structures * large amounts of time invested into mastery(reflexes and coordination to relocate resources, player or non-player characters competitively to achieve victory usually in a simulated battle). * may be emotionally invested into gameplay mechanics or how a series or genre develops and grows. an enthusiasts player might be someone who plays the sims and has a tremendous amount of mods or has spent a lot of time invested into creating their ideal. it might be the shooter player with lightning reflexes. it might be the fan of japanse rpgs who has all the final fantasy series and has beaten them all. it might be a person just starting to collect or play and found a passion in doing so. it could even be the casual player who has collected and beat 100s or 1000s of simple puzzle games, or master a game with simple rules like tetris through time and deliberate effort. if you notice in my descriptions none of these require a person to be of any gender or race. they also if looking at the demographics do appeal to different genders to various degrees, but there is no rule that says you have to be of one gender to enjoy a category and as you pointed out 15% of poc or women enjoy enthusiast gaming. that percentage is actually higher for poc and lower for females than 15%. this is just american gaming, obviously the numbers are different in asia and europe. as you can imagine regardless of your physical body if you are in the latter category and have invested a lot of your resources into something you might utilize a word to identify yourself and be troubled when some people shallowly try to conflate your end of the spectrum of the hobby with the other end. you have a lot more vested in it mentally, emotionally, and financially. that is not to say that their are not great things can come about from hybrids, but balance is difficult and doing so haphazardly results in low quality and displeasure from one or both sides in both commentary and articles about the games and the people who play them and the games themselves.",cobt14z,461.2424371911172,1,1423118576,103,19,3837,0,49.430843838561515,758.0,1155.0,27.0,1,0.037037037037037035,0.18518518518518517,0.18518518518518517,0.25925925925925924,0.0,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.0,0.14814814814814814,0.07407407407407407,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.037037037037037035,0.0,1.0,0.08089706427556731,0.24802110817941952,0.0,0,0.0,769,77.02,64.71,42.69,65.20,28.48,20.16,84.66,50.85,8.19,3.77,0.13,0.00,1.95,0.00,1.69,4.42,7.41,13.78,8.71,3.38,10.27,0.78,11.96,6.50,2.73,1.56,1.30,4.55,4.29,2.86,0.78,0.00,0.26,0.26,9.10,0.00,0.00,0.26,0.00,14.95,2.08,0.78,1.30,8.06,0.78,6.37,1.17,0.52,0.65,0.00,0.39,0.13,0.13,0.13,0.00,10.14,3.38,2.86,3.12,1.69,0.65,0.91,7.93,1.56,12.61,1.30,7.15,3.90,3.25,5.33,0.00,1.95,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,10.66,3.51,2.60,0.52,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.52,0.78,0.00,1.04,1.69

t3_3iuvph,"while i have to say i pretty much agree with you, i have a few counterarguments. the biggest issue surrounds your statement that violence is nature's way of controlling overpopulation. from an evolutionary point of view, it is our development and continual increase of intellectual capacity that changes the way our world works. for example, as we as a race become (and have become) more intelligent, this leads to the change in behavior: the shift from being extremely violent species that could not maintain an as developed of a society as currently, to a much less violent (in comparison) species that has utilized collaboration to achieve greater things (i.e. ""civilized society, with higher mortality rates, moral codes, much more advanced technology, and the opportunity to essentially accelerate our intellectual evolution). while i agree with you that violence is a part of life currently, i believe that the logic that we can ""transcend"" violent culture means that we should not simply embrace violence as the answer. think of it this way, it might be clearer what i am trying to say. back billions of years ago, when the first organisms evolved, their way of getting ""ahead"" (surviving) was simply whichever cell(s) could get the most nutrients. this could be considered the birth of violence, so to speak. now, think of how simple these organisms are. over billions of years, these evolved into all species on earth, with the forms of violence (used purely for the act of survival) evolving with it. as our species evolved more and more, less intraspecific violence was accompanied by greater survivability due to increased intellect/less violence ruining progress (think of too much violence in a intellectually developing society as a bully child going around and stomping on all the other kids' lego buildings). so essentially, violence, while an innate instinct of our species in certain circumstances, acts to destroy any developmental/societal advances. (it could be argued that those who destroy others through violence are simply winning in the ""survival of the fittest"", but if they are destroying a certain group, they destroy that destroyed group's technological advances in the process--which would negatively impact the general development of the human race. now, to get to your point more specifically. there is a stark difference between learning to embrace death/infant mortality/etc as a part of life, and embracing violence as e answer to all problems. i agree that especially currently there is too much of a focus on misguided morality (think political correctness obsession). as for your discussion below about isis/syria, i am kind of confused as to what you mean. i could suggest that a decent amount of people hold the attitude of: let them kill each other, just keep me out of it (pacifism). this idea lets those less intellectually developed to kill off each other, as (and i can't reiterate this enough) extreme violence/acceptance of violence will simply destroy the society. this is the key point. so while i agree (and would guess most people sort of agree with what you are saying about violence?), i do not think that this in any way elicits the strict acceptance, let alone embracement, of violence.",cujuu2a,219.89316120461584,1,1440871069,22,6,2307,0,45.26750000000001,528.0,869.0,24.0,1,0.041666666666666664,0.0,0.08333333333333333,0.16666666666666666,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.0,0.08333333333333333,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.0,0.0,0.16666666666666666,0.0,0.625,0.0364654669002495,0.25946969696969696,0.0,0,0.0,535,78.33,70.62,25.29,4.69,25.48,27.48,87.66,51.40,13.83,6.17,2.43,1.68,1.31,0.00,0.75,7.66,6.92,15.89,7.10,4.67,5.79,0.93,11.40,7.48,5.42,1.50,0.56,5.42,9.91,3.93,5.98,0.37,2.24,0.37,7.85,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,12.52,3.55,1.31,1.87,2.24,1.87,2.06,0.93,0.19,0.75,0.00,0.37,0.00,0.37,0.00,0.00,8.79,2.43,2.99,2.99,1.68,0.19,0.75,8.60,0.75,10.84,1.87,5.79,3.36,2.24,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.37,0.93,0.93,0.00,0.00,0.93,0.00,0.00,18.50,4.30,5.79,0.37,0.00,0.19,0.00,0.37,1.31,0.75,4.30,1.12
t3_3ivl97,"you say kleptocracy, but what you are really talking about is run of the mill corruption and embezzlement which are practiced by all kinds of people. the current top dogs of this kind of thing would either be the chinese or wall street executives, depending on your point of view. in countries with weak legal systems corruption is found at all levels (china), while in other's it is usually only found at higher levels of authority and power (like in the us). there's nothing exceptionally corrupt about black people and there is no such thing as ""black governance"". for one thing, there is little to no political and moral connection between black people in america and those in africa. for 99% of each group they will never meet, interact or learn anything from each other. they do not even have the same kind of corruption - your examples show americans siphoning off funds that generally will not be missed and manipulating test scores. african leaders raid national treasuries and force other's into slave labor while withholding un food donations. it is not the same action, motivation or means. to link the two groups together just because they have the same skin color is missing the point. if you look at the countries and groups with the most rampant corruption, the unifying factors are poverty, weak rule of law and income inequality. these three factors feed corruption and are strengthened by it, though corruption can creep in even without them. really, all it needs it the wrong person to have even a little bit of power. while many people living in these corrupt areas happen to be black, there are other places which fit those criteria populated by latinos, middle easterners, asians, native americans and white people which all fit the bill. there are also plenty of black politicians and businessmen who are not corrupt. corruption simply isnt a racial issue, it is economic, moral and political.all your examples were of black people and countries, but they are not any worse than other scandals like... 1. the british government; child sex rings, bribery, manipulation of the media and more from mps and especially the house of lords, well bred white people! they literally take stipends given to them by taxpayers and laugh as they spend it on hookers and blow. 2. the communist party of china's rampant corruption including thousands of fake ""government workers"" who exist only on paper so their salary can go in their bosses pocket, horrifically corrupt bidding processes, safety inspections and court proceedings which exist only to fuel bribery, and government spending so rife with graft they may as well not bother to track it. the former head of china's rail industry was caught with so much illegally gotten cash that it was literally rotting in his garage. ----- ok i am on mobile and it is getting late here, so i am just going to list some more without going into detail: 1. mexican drug cartels and the police 2. basically all of columbia, brazil and nicaragua 3. south africans of all races 4. russian oligarchs, especially oil executives 5. wall street executives who become lobbyists and government officials, and vice versa, in a cycle of looking the other way rather than enforcing the law 6. chris christie, former governor blagoyevich (sp) who tried to sell obama's senate seat after he got elected, everyone dumb enough to get fined for campaign finance laws, the entire lobbying industry... 7. a huge number of industries in india, pakistan and indonesia 8. eurovision, the international olympic committee and especially fifa and so on... tldr; it is not just black people, *everyone is corrupt*.",cuk0zn3,585.0362410049341,1,1440882743,18,6,1906,0,54.60319932465501,601.0,954.0,34.0,1,0.029411764705882353,0.0,0.08823529411764706,0.3235294117647059,0.0,0.08823529411764706,0.029411764705882353,0.11764705882352941,0.058823529411764705,0.029411764705882353,0.0,0.0,0.11764705882352941,0.0,0.8823529411764707,0.025563325563325568,0.34442595673876875,0.0,0,0.0,611,64.71,55.20,22.82,23.22,18.52,22.09,80.85,47.14,9.66,3.60,0.33,0.16,0.98,0.33,1.80,6.06,4.58,12.77,6.55,6.22,7.86,2.29,11.13,5.07,3.44,1.47,2.45,3.93,2.78,1.31,1.47,0.00,0.33,0.33,7.69,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.33,11.13,1.15,1.15,0.65,2.29,2.45,4.75,3.11,2.29,0.49,0.16,1.64,0.33,0.65,0.33,0.33,10.15,1.64,1.15,6.55,0.98,0.49,2.29,7.86,0.82,11.29,0.98,8.35,1.96,5.89,0.33,0.33,2.62,0.49,0.00,0.98,0.16,0.33,0.16,0.33,0.00,16.69,6.38,5.56,0.16,0.33,0.00,0.16,0.98,0.65,0.98,0.98,0.49

t3_3bivk9,"i think generally if you invoke morality at the level of macroeconomics (the economy of nations, or conglomerates like the euro), you are not being helpful. to begin with, greece was not greece when it made these decisions. greece was already part of the eurozone. greece was analogous to a kid with below-average credit who has spectacularly high-earning parents. moreover, those parents (say, germany) had a huge nest egg that they were trying to find investments for. so they bought the kid's bullshit that about how he was going to create a spectacularly profitable business and loaned him a ton of money, and essentially vouched to other people that he was a good investment risk. i'm being a bit flippant with the analogies, but the tone of articles you saw when greece was about to enter the eurozone were very similar to this (greece was a (somewhat) underdeveloped economy with (at least perceived) the whole backing of the eurozone. moreover, you had a similar dynamic between greece and the northern euro nations that you have between the us and china. an export-oriented economy (say germany or china) helps maintain it is export-oriented growth by devaluing its currency and keeping its exports competitive. china does this by investing its economic surplus in us bonds, germany and other export-oriented members of the eurozone managed to do this by incorporating less economically prosperous members of europe (spain, portugal, italy, greece, etc) into their currency union so their currency would behave more like a poorer country. in fact, to this day, the export-oriented growth of germany looks a lot more like a developing country rather than the developed country it is because of this sort of economic sleight of hand with the euro. a germany run with the mark would have experienced export decline due to currency valuation long ago without the eurozone. now it turns out that greece was a bad bet. greeks made out like bandits with the loose money. german companies made out like bandits by finding a way to sort of ""suspend gravity"" in an economic sense. b the second narrative that i am describing is more difficult to understand than the conventional narrative where greeks are just lazy. but in economics there has to be a seller and a buyer, and on the level of macroeconomic transactions between countries, the seller enables the buyer and vice versa. so it is very convenient to say it is all the greeks' fault--they're lazy profligates!--but the truth is these relationships are reciprocal. for every profligate son, you can construct the narrative of a lazy, indulgent, investment-mad father who hoped his son would be his ticket to the big-time. also, because of the nature of these capital flows between countries, you can actually create a scenario where the father benefits economically from loaning money to his son (say, it impoverishes him so he qualifies for more income breaks for certain things and has to pay less in taxes?). so i am not trying to say it is germany or the northern euro's fault--i'm trying to say that it is both their fault. (the current situation: greece (the son) does not have money to pay back his loans. in fact, the payments required of him are so high that he has to sell his car, spend hours riding a crappy bus to work, eat crap food so he gets sick, and worry about money constantly so he gets no sleep. but the parent (germany et al) insists that they be paid back, even though it looks like the son is never going to have enough money to pay him back. the father *could* just write it off as a bad investment and take the hit, hoping that his son will get back on his feet and at least not be a drain on him in the future. but he has worried that his son will not learn the lesson, and that his other kids will learn to be lazy, so he makes an example of his son. at some point the son (greece) objects to the ridiculousness of the situation, and says ""screw it, if you are going to keep doing this, i am never going to pay you back and i am fine with being out of the family"". of course, being out of the family means he has probably have to declare bankruptcy, will not have someone to cosign for his car or credit card and will have to pay for everything in cash for a long time. but he has thinking leaving the family may be the less painful solution)",csn64dl,168.30745628474082,1,1435638379,223,24,39963,0,53.53212115301258,769.0,1157.0,30.0,1,0.1,0.0,0.23333333333333334,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.0,0.13333333333333333,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.0,0.7333333333333334,0.0863965318568899,0.247074122236671,0.0,0,0.0,780,76.78,70.94,6.53,13.59,26.90,19.23,86.15,55.00,12.18,6.41,0.90,0.26,1.15,3.33,0.77,5.77,9.23,14.62,9.36,5.26,5.90,1.41,16.28,3.33,2.69,0.90,0.13,2.56,4.49,1.79,2.69,0.38,0.64,0.00,10.51,2.31,0.00,0.00,4.87,10.13,1.67,1.41,1.15,2.69,1.15,3.59,2.05,0.38,0.90,0.38,1.28,0.51,0.26,0.13,0.38,7.18,1.79,1.79,1.79,1.15,0.90,2.82,10.38,1.54,10.26,1.79,6.41,2.69,5.64,0.51,0.38,7.05,0.13,0.00,0.64,0.51,0.13,0.00,0.00,0.00,14.87,3.59,4.62,0.13,0.00,0.13,0.13,1.79,0.51,0.77,2.95,0.26

t3_37ji34,"i will try to focus on the market issue and the mechanism adopted, and not speak about the moral issue, as you seem to agree that feeding the one in needs is a worthy goal. first, one of your disagreement with the law is that it is only the supermarkets that support the cost of this. it is true from a certain point of view (i will discuss it later), but it is not different from what other taxation means are. let us take the example of the household appliances. when you buy a new dishwasher, the company that sold it to you is forced to take the old one back and dispose of it (unless you wish to keep it). it has a cost to them, as they have to dispose of it correctly. the cost of such garbage disposal is only supported by household appliances sellers. not food distributors and other companies. the situation is the same here: only supermarket would pay for the feeding of the poor. the idea of paying through the household appliances companies, is that the tax will automatically be scaled by market change. if one year there is twice as much of dishwasher sold, the tax income (in a large view, not only money) will be twice as big too, ensuring that garbage disposal facilities get enough money. if all cost were paid by the whole society, such scaling would not occur, and the supermarket would have to support the waste disposal of the household appliances companies. but why would they have to support a tax increase if they did not sold more food? the situation is the same in a lot of field (cigarettes and alcohol pays for medical care, heavy polluters pay for environmental safety programs, vehicles pays for road maintenance, and so on). on other field, the whole society pays for what has no dominating actor (schools, police, and so). and in the end, the whole society will support all the remaining costs. but, the supermarket will not exactly support the cost of food donation alone. they are only a catalyst. they will adjust their prices to support the additional cost, and all buyers will so pay a little. so the whole society will support the cost of it. and the implications are heavy: higher prices will mean higher vat. higher vat will mean the government will have too much money (sort of...) and will so be able to lowers taxes. and lower taxes mean more profit for the supermarkets. we have here an (idealist) closed loop, were the difference is that the feeding of the homeless shifts from tax-money use to direct distribution, more efficient. a great advantage of such a system is that it avoid corruption: there is no more money on the table. only unsellable food. so this is a form of taxation. another interest in this instead of paying welfare is that there is less administrative work associated with it, so lower costs. so lower state expanses, and so lower direct taxes. now for the problem of lower demand. in a short time, it will probably decrease a little (roughly the amount of food currently given to charity). but the net results will be the better life state of the homeless. and a better life state means there will have more chances to get back into the system, and so pay taxes and pay for their food (of course other actions are to be taken too, the supermarkets have now to do a little lobbying in this direction). more over, the one in needs do not eat enough. so giving them more food will not decrease the demand, as they will only eat more that they do now. we will have, to the contrary an augmentation of the consumption. yes, they do not pay for it currently, but again they will if we push them back into the system. the other part is the worth of the currently throw away food. it is hard to evaluate, as it cannot be sold by supermarket yet is used to feed peoples. it is the same as every garbage: you, as an individual, cannot get any money from it. but the society as a whole can trough the recycling and other means. and here comes the government: it use something worth nothing to the supermarkets and make profit from it. it is not different from using the other garbages from the supermarkets. only the means of disposal changes. food is only a new step on this road. recycling of plastic matters had an impact on petroleum companies, because less new plastic is made. burning household garbage to create electricity had an impact on gas and coal market. and so on. i will end by this: remember that the government itself has to make money. their income is the taxes. so they have interest in keeping the supermarkets companies very profitable. and to bring as much taxpayers in the system as they can. and because of taxes are only proportional to money flux, this mean their goal is also to make supermarket more profitable, on a long run. if this law has really a negative impact on the supermarkets, it will be adapted (by lowering the taxes or by other means).",crngt5j,1006.896475237296,1,1432807451,148,22,25132,0,66.98948529563513,881.0,1287.0,55.0,1,0.03636363636363636,0.0,0.18181818181818182,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01818181818181818,0.0,0.4363636363636364,0.043775856194156845,0.18501702610669693,0.0,0,0.0,882,74.89,45.05,11.99,55.71,16.04,17.57,89.12,55.78,9.64,3.51,0.34,0.45,0.68,0.00,2.04,6.12,10.88,13.15,10.32,5.90,7.37,1.93,16.44,6.46,4.42,0.45,0.91,3.29,4.54,3.06,1.47,0.11,0.11,0.91,4.42,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,10.66,1.47,1.93,1.59,1.47,1.02,4.54,0.79,0.23,0.11,0.45,2.27,0.00,0.57,0.00,1.93,6.58,0.57,1.47,3.06,1.81,0.34,1.81,12.02,2.61,9.18,1.13,5.90,2.49,6.12,0.23,0.79,7.37,0.11,0.00,0.23,0.00,0.00,0.23,0.00,0.00,14.06,6.35,4.54,0.68,0.00,0.11,0.00,0.11,0.00,0.00,2.27,0.00
t3_37ji34,"hey i just found the sub, and your request to have your view changed. (i sent this as a pm initially, as i came here on a read only version) it seemed to me you had 2 major points. 1) giving away food would lower demand and thus the store would sell less. 2) if the govt wanted control of the food it should buy it and then it could do with it what it wanted. let me address #2 first. in many places (bc canada as an example) food banks are given a superior purchasing power, it is 3:1 here. so if they go to buy food, each dollar can purchase what $3 should be able to. the reason i bring this up is my point of view, which is that donations to charity are tax deductible. charitable donations are not only tax deductible, they normally are done so at a higher rate than write offs. so if you write off some cabbages that cost you $5, you get to write off $5 (reducing your income by as much and thus saving taxes on that $5.) given that in canada corporate tax is a flat 15% this means that writing off $5 is worth 0.75 cents to the store. however, charitable donations instead recieve a tax credit of 47% of thier retail value. this means that donating that same cabbage to a shelter that qualified as a charity would now mean the store was able to recover $2.35. this is a gain of $1.60 per $5 write off. as such, the government is buying the food, albeit at a reduced rate. however if you look at my earlier comment where food banks have improved purchasing power, this is not only inline with that, but it is the government purchasing the food at higher rate than if it was purchased by the food bank itself. due to the fact i am not french, or living in france i do not know their current set up for charitable donations vs write offs, but it is generally better to donate to charity than it is to write off, and so the government is in fact purchasing the food, albeit at a discount. that being said lets refer to point #1. due to the food being purchased, at a reduced rate, and being distributed to those would would either not be able to purchase food themselves, or would choose to eat garbage, the impact of this is greatly reduced. if a homeless person goes from eating garbage to eating food donated by a supermarket, there is no impact on demand. if a homeless person who can not afford food in any way shape or form is being fed by food via donation instead of direct purchase, there is an impact, but it is lessened in that the donation is partially paid for (almost 50% in canada). as to your last partial point, that taxes are to be evenly distributed i would suggest you look at some value added taxes (up to 18% on things like eating at a resturant in other countries) these taxes are in place merely for the government to harvest extra money, and not because the things being consumed put any strain on a medical or other system. this is still taxation and not theft. i would suggest removing 'fair' from your argument, and focus on 'legal'. your point is about theft, not about morality. taxes in and of themselves can almost all be argued to not be 'fair'. cheers edited because pms did not allow for nice formatting, and people do not want to read a giant block of text.",crokrh8,844.4180483563002,1,1432886108,148,22,103789,1,69.76613963963963,592.0,819.0,30.0,1,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.3333333333333333,0.23333333333333334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.03333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.0,0.7666666666666666,0.08032293377120962,0.20270270270270271,0.0,0,0.0,612,68.98,38.42,28.81,66.00,22.67,14.22,87.42,54.90,11.93,4.90,1.96,0.16,1.96,0.00,0.82,7.03,6.54,15.36,10.13,4.41,6.86,2.12,16.83,4.08,3.10,0.82,3.43,1.96,3.43,2.78,0.65,0.16,0.33,0.16,5.23,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,13.40,1.80,1.80,3.59,3.10,0.49,6.21,0.82,0.65,0.16,0.00,3.59,0.00,0.49,0.00,3.10,6.21,1.31,1.31,3.27,0.65,0.00,3.27,10.29,0.16,11.27,1.31,8.33,1.63,5.39,0.00,0.16,8.99,0.16,0.00,0.33,0.00,0.16,0.00,0.00,0.00,14.38,4.41,4.58,0.16,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.98,1.96,2.29

t3_2yrog1,"concerns over police militarization go part-and-parcel with discussions about fourth amendment rights and the role of an armed, peacetime presence in a country that is highly skeptical of sitting police power. disclaimer that when i say ""police"" in that last sentence i mean the ability to police - much like the military can police or a teacher can police a classroom - not a police department, specifically. when we talk about the need to adapt to new threats, that's understandable. the problem is that the alarm travels back to issues of exigency and imminence that generally are acceptable reasons to carve into the traditional probable cause requirement. the issue with swat teams, for example, is not that they are militarized so much as there is a cavalier exercise of that force with respect to the traditionally constitutionally protected home and person. that encroachment is very real, often manifesting in fear, property destruction, and personal harm. that's not the mark of a free society. likewise, militarization of police has become increasingly untethered from realistic threats that face most municipalities. most places are not rife with gang wars or terrorist-like threats. small towns do not need giant tanks to battle south american drug cartels bleeding into iowan territory. what it indicates is a police culture that values presumptive use of force over judicious, necessary use of force. it turns on its head the idea that police are there as a resource for people and instead a quasi-military force to be used against them. naturally, being forceful and protecting people are not mutually exclusive but the starting point for municipal and town police forces should be one that respects law-abiding citizens first and foremost, threatening harm only when necessary as a protective measure, rather than the assumption that harm is the starting point until given reason otherwise. the burden is not on the population to prove beforehand that they are not likely criminals or their basic rights be respected. finally, in the us, when you read about the debates and discussion regarding the second amendment, military powers, and quartering of soldiers, you see an implicit suspicion of the government's ability to use its own arms against the population. police are generally good, well-intentioned people, but they are still an arm of the government. it is a natural off-shoot of what we are taught from day one culturally and politically to be skeptical of exercise of police power. the kind of restrained protective militia force that was originally envisioned erodes when it transforms into the sitting military presence we didn't want permeating the whole of daily life. it is normal and politically healthy to worry about that.",cpcgl5a,372.39080583436834,1,1426166644,22,8,22494,0,36.5212137486574,441.0,765.0,19.0,72,0.15789473684210525,0.05263157894736842,0.3157894736842105,0.3684210526315789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.10526315789473684,0.05263157894736842,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.0,0.05263157894736842,1.2105263157894732,0.06088743772567302,0.3219954648526077,0.0,0,0.0,447,80.86,51.79,22.94,4.89,23.53,27.29,85.91,49.66,8.95,2.91,0.45,0.89,0.45,0.00,1.12,6.04,8.72,13.87,7.61,5.82,6.49,2.01,11.86,4.70,1.79,1.57,1.34,1.34,6.26,1.79,3.80,2.01,1.57,0.00,6.04,0.00,0.22,0.00,0.00,14.09,2.91,3.36,1.34,3.13,1.12,4.47,0.45,0.22,0.22,0.00,2.01,1.12,1.12,0.00,0.00,15.21,1.79,0.89,11.19,0.22,2.24,1.12,9.84,0.00,10.07,0.89,5.37,4.03,5.82,0.89,0.22,0.22,0.00,0.22,0.22,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.22,0.00,12.08,4.25,4.47,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,2.01,0.45,0.89,0.00,0.00
t3_2w73vi,"first, you should read the book before you develop serious views on this. the argument is two-part; one part is about economic structure, one part is about social identity. you say this: > liberal democratic principles are a broad but genuinely meaningful set of principles that can govern societies in a large variety of cultural traditions but the *moral* value of liberal and democratic ideas is not really connected to fukuyama's arguments that ever non-liberal, non-democratic state will experience pressure until it collapses and becomes liberal-democratic. > fukuyama is not saying that all countries will inevitably become liberal democracies it's hard to read the book any other way. the book does not just say that the non-ld countries are less happy or less perfect in some abstract sense; in fact, he actively avoids a defense of liberal democracy in those terms, in favor of considerations that make it unlikely members of a non-ld state will continue to cooperate with the state and allow it to survive.

t3_3d26wz,"you are in that sense correct that in an economy at capacity, government can usually not produce magic growth (unlike an economy in recession, where government can produce growth). it can however influence the long term trajectory of growth by strengethening long term market confidence, improving public health, education, produdcing a regulatory enviorment which is friendly to innovation, protecting the economy from large volatility (volatility is generally very costly, for various reasons) or by increasing market effiency (externalities, monopolies etc.). there are situations were government can easily produce massive frowth (in recessions) and even if not in a recession government regulation can influence long term growth (usually only quite slightly and in a long term). there are even more ways for a government to absolutly wreck an economy. ofc in a pluralistic society it is rather hard for an individual to make a huge difference but i would argue that you are not correct. let's take fdr and the new deal as an example where the presidency was the main driver behind the programm, so it is possible for an individual politician to make a signifcant difference in economic performance (especially in time of crisis).",ct28b6n,218.41311692443398,1,1436829553,60,12,84971,0,26.713846153846163,195.0,350.0,7.0,1,0.0,0.0,0.42857142857142855,0.8571428571428571,0.0,0.14285714285714285,0.0,0.14285714285714285,0.42857142857142855,0.14285714285714285,0.0,0.0,0.2857142857142857,0.0,2.4285714285714284,0.0789855072463768,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0,0.0,195,87.18,43.89,63.54,44.55,32.50,32.31,87.18,49.23,5.64,2.05,0.51,0.51,1.03,0.00,0.00,3.59,9.74,13.33,8.21,7.69,4.62,1.54,7.69,5.13,2.56,1.54,0.00,1.03,2.56,1.54,0.51,0.00,0.51,0.00,4.62,0.00,0.51,0.00,0.00,15.38,1.03,4.10,1.54,3.59,2.05,5.64,1.03,0.00,0.00,0.51,0.51,0.00,0.51,0.00,0.00,11.79,1.03,1.03,8.72,1.03,1.03,1.03,8.72,0.00,17.44,2.56,10.77,4.10,12.82,0.00,0.00,6.15,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,14.87,3.59,4.62,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.51,6.15,0.00

t3_2vnyz6,"trans people have some needs unique to them, but all the things that the lgb folks are fighting for also benefit the trans community. consider marriage for instance. i am a trans gal. i currently live in a state without same sex marriage. because of this, i basically do not have the right to get married, no matter who i am attracted to. why is this? well, one of the biggest reasons of going through the trouble of getting married is to have a secure, indisputable, incontestable marriage. if i am married, i want to make sure my partner can and i can share health insurance, hospital visitation rights, inheritance, medical decisions, etc without some party coming out of the woodwork to challenge it. so, let us say i like guys. i fall in love and marry a guy. then, a few years down the line, my husband dies. i am grieving, and on top of this, suddenly i have a legal fight on my hands. his family does not support our union, and they have take me to court. they argue, ""this is clearly a same sex marriage. isleepinahammock was born male, and that's what should matter for legal purposes. does not matter what ""her"" legal documents say, birth gender is all that matters. the marriage should be annulled and the blood relatives of the deceased receive all of his property. isleepinahammock should get nothing."" ok, so maybe instead of liking guys, i like gals instead. if my state is using birth gender for marriage, i will just go to the government office and ask for a marriage certificate. me and my gal go and get married. maybe we get denied anyway due to my legal documents. let us say we are allowed to get married. a few years later, she dies. her conservative family comes out and challenges our marriage in court saying, ""this was clearly a same-sex marriage and should be annulled. isleepinahammock lives as a female, looks like a female, and has legal documents that all say female. she wore a wedding dress to her wedding for god's sake! this marriage should be ruled null and void, and all property go to blood relatives."" in my state, there is literally no such thing as a secure trans marriage. there is inconsistent case law on the books about whether courts should use the gender on your legal documents or the gender you were born with for purposes of marriage. until we have same-sex marriage here, i will not be able to get married to anyone, male or female, in a way that can't later be contested in court. pretty much the only way i could have an uncontestable marriage is if i were to marry a trans guy with male legal documents. then, no matter which definition a court chose to use, the marriage would be valid.",cojdh1b,412.17180880891016,1,1423761121,250,43,1822,0,71.16386363636366,480.0,686.0,33.0,6,0.030303030303030304,0.0,0.09090909090909091,0.15151515151515152,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030303030303030304,0.0,0.030303030303030304,0.0,0.0,0.12121212121212122,0.0,0.4545454545454545,0.0378844246031746,0.21666666666666667,0.0,0,0.0,482,58.67,79.09,11.18,72.39,14.61,18.46,88.59,53.11,13.07,9.13,5.19,1.45,0.41,1.45,0.62,3.94,7.26,11.62,10.37,4.36,6.22,2.28,18.26,3.53,2.49,1.24,0.21,2.07,4.56,3.53,1.04,0.00,0.62,0.21,17.01,6.43,1.04,2.49,2.07,11.20,0.83,2.07,2.70,2.28,1.87,3.32,1.45,0.21,1.04,0.21,2.90,0.83,1.04,0.83,0.00,14.11,8.92,1.24,1.66,1.87,0.62,1.87,13.90,1.24,8.51,1.66,3.73,3.32,2.90,0.83,0.41,0.41,0.21,0.83,0.62,0.00,0.00,0.21,0.21,0.21,16.18,6.43,7.05,0.00,0.00,0.21,0.21,0.41,1.24,0.62,0.00,0.00

t3_3i7k0u,"here is something i can attest to as a guy who spent a good bit of his younger years in a private school. a lot of good teachers quit from the public schools due to red tape and excessive amounts of paperwork involved. these teachers, the ones of talked to (who are some of the best i have ever had) argue that they much prefer teaching where they have more freedom to be creative and instill real knowledge and fun activities, not run through a curriculum as quickly as possible to meet state standards. i worked an internship last year with a teacher at a smaller private school and he was able to have his students do debates, projects, plays, and art. he was able to make them love and respect him, and they all learned a lot-even the at-risk kids. i can tell you it is a lot more effective than handing out a blue diamond book every week and teaching to the test. if that does not get you, here is another point-the public school near my house was massive and i was barely even a number to them. private schools are much smaller and more personal. do not you think a lot of at-risk kids would benefit from having their teacher know them as more than just a name on a list of grades with 500-1000 other names on it? they do not have as much opportunity to sit in the back of the class and get away with murder. it also helps foster discussion, as smaller class sizes are easier to work with than massive ones. also, in regards to bullying. oftentimes, draconian state laws basically prohibit anything resembling coherent thought on that topic. i am sure if you have been on reddit as long as i have, you have heard plenty of ""no tolerance policy"" stories. i have met people in real life that have had that happen to them. it is not the least bit uncommon. private schools are allowed to make their own rules and can handle bullying in a rational way (it also helps that you would probably personally know the administration official you go to for it, whereas that wouldn't be as common in a large public school).",cue07hc,184.6918547794335,1,1440436255,158,24,3654,0,67.61058823529414,376.0,519.0,17.0,1,0.17647058823529413,0.0,0.058823529411764705,0.29411764705882354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5294117647058824,0.04009402056277056,0.27925531914893614,0.0,0,0.0,382,70.18,77.61,17.72,82.15,22.47,18.32,91.36,55.24,13.35,8.12,2.36,0.00,1.83,1.31,2.62,5.24,7.07,15.71,9.95,3.66,7.07,1.83,15.18,8.64,6.02,0.79,0.52,5.24,5.50,4.19,1.05,0.52,0.52,0.00,13.09,0.00,0.26,0.00,1.57,11.26,2.62,1.57,1.57,3.14,1.05,3.14,0.79,0.52,0.26,0.00,0.52,0.00,0.26,0.00,0.00,10.47,1.31,2.09,5.50,1.83,0.52,3.40,11.26,0.00,10.21,0.79,7.33,2.36,7.33,1.31,0.26,0.26,0.00,0.26,0.26,0.00,0.26,0.00,0.00,0.00,10.73,4.19,3.14,0.00,0.00,0.26,0.00,1.31,0.52,0.26,1.05,0.00

t3_3da31o,"the major advantage the electoral college has over a straight popular vote system is that it rewards getting broad support from across the country over getting very strong support from only a few smaller segments. this makes it much easier for the president to govern effectively. the united states is a huge, diverse country. people in massachusetts, alabama, california, and wisconsin have some very different cultural and political assumptions from one another. if you have grown up in one part of the country and move to another, you notice this pretty quickly. your new neighbors think of themselves as true americans and speak the same language (maybe with a funny accent), but they structure their lives based on different assumptions. presidents face the nearly impossible challenge of needing to simultaneously appeal to the whole of this diverse country. even if a part of the country does not love his/her policies, they still need to respect him/her to some extent. they have to feel that the president is still their president. otherwise, the union is weakened and may fall apart. this is a real risk. in the election of 1860, lincoln became president with his support almost entirely from the northern free states. the south seceded almost immediately afterwards. the electoral college is a kludgy but reasonably effective way to force presidential candidates to appeal to as many different parts of this diverse country as possible. candidates face two basic choices when they campaign: appeal to people who may not currently support you, and increase turnout and enthusiasm from those that already do support you. a pure popular vote system gives an advantage to the second strategy. rather than spend a lot of time and resources convincing the few people on the fence, you can instead use those resources to get the most turnout possible out of the people already on your side. if you are a democrat, that means appealing to liberal voters in california and new york to increase your vote share in those states from 65% to 70%. even if that turns off moderates in ohio and decreases your vote share from 50% to 48%, you are coming out ahead. the electoral college puts on a limit on the effectiveness of this tactic. after you pass 50% of the votes in a state, there is no benefit to winning by a greater amount. so instead, candidates are forced to focus their efforts on convincing voters that do not already agree with them. if you are a conservative, you will want to moderate your platform to try to get your vote share in ohio from 49% to 51%. even if your base is less excited and your margin in alabama falls from 70% to 65%, you are coming out ahead. i think these kinds of tactical changes are healthy for having an actually effective government. with a pure popular vote, it would be possible to win the election by appealing strongly to a particular narrow segment of the country. even if this alienates everyone else, as long as your segment can deliever 50.1% of the votes cast you will come out ahead. in contrast, the electoral college forces you to appeal to a broader cross-section. you can't win if 51% of the population loves you and 49% hates you. you need to get most of the country to be at least pretty ok with you. given how diverse this country is, i think having a reasonably broad appeal is necessary to being able to govern the country effectively. i think we are better off with a president who got 49.9% of the popular vote but has pretty even support across the country vs. a president who gets 50.1% of the vote but who the rest of the country absolutely hates. that's not perfectly fair, but it is a price i am willing to pay.",ct38qcz,403.17607685083965,1,1436903949,125,9,3616,0,57.4154247104247,630.0,984.0,37.0,1,0.0,0.05405405405405406,0.32432432432432434,0.08108108108108109,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05405405405405406,0.0,0.5135135135135136,0.029273504273504274,0.22698412698412698,0.0,0,0.0,648,90.29,79.33,37.79,98.84,19.64,23.46,85.34,52.78,11.73,7.10,0.62,0.15,4.17,0.77,1.39,4.63,9.10,16.82,6.17,4.17,5.25,0.93,12.65,7.10,3.24,0.93,2.93,3.40,7.25,6.48,0.62,0.15,0.31,0.00,10.03,0.00,0.15,0.31,0.46,13.89,3.09,2.31,2.31,4.32,1.23,4.63,0.31,0.00,0.15,0.15,0.93,0.31,0.31,0.00,0.00,9.72,1.23,2.62,4.48,2.93,0.15,1.23,11.11,1.39,13.89,2.16,9.10,2.78,3.40,0.00,0.15,0.62,0.00,0.00,0.46,0.00,0.00,0.46,0.00,0.00,12.04,5.25,3.40,0.15,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.15,0.00,0.31,0.31,2.47

t3_3jgkfh,"i am not really trying to change your view here (i kind of agree), but one thing i find interesting is how the perception of university (""college"") aged kids varies from country to country and culture to culture. in western countries like canada and the us, we expect kids like adults in high school to some degree. teenagers tend to buy their own clothes, work a summer job or a part time job(s), own their own car, drink coffee, smoke (though this is changing), and parents/adults in general turn a blind eye to a lot of other things (like underage drinking) because they once did the same thing. in pretty much any culture that is not the west, high school aged kids do not have any of these freedoms at all and do not really get them until later on, thus ""college life"" tends to be more toned down. ? i've lived in japan and korea for almost a decade (combined) with the majority of time spent in korea. i used to be an english teacher here and have worked in plenty of both private institutions as well as public schools in both countries (covering all age ranges). there is a saying in expat communities in both countries that there is a six year maturity gap between a westerner and a korean/japanese person of the same age (usually brought up when dating) *if* they are in their teens or twenties. the reason being that kids here do not really have any autonomy whatsoever so they mature more slowly in some ways (and i would argue more safely). nor do these kids really *try* to behave like adults. it's a huge cry from what i experienced when i was in high school where half the kids drove themselves to school, smoked (various things), had ""serious"" relationships that their parents knew about, worked part time jobs, sometimes lived on their own and didn't have a curfew. on this side of the world people do not get that much autonomy until they are 25+ and that's only if they get married/move out (the former is usually the condition for the latter). that said, i have come to conclude that what we do in the west, particularly north america, is a bit of an anomaly compared with the rest of the world. we tend to give kids too much freedom too soon (though i would say that they give kids/young adults *too little* freedom here and that has its own set of problems). i moved out when i was 18 and have been living independently of my parents ever since, however in retrospect, i do not think i was mature enough to handle the responsibility of living on my own until i was in my early-to-mid twenties and i think that a lot of people feel the same way. the reasoning behind this is pretty easy, too. this really started happening in earnest after world war 2 when western societies existed in a socio-economic bubble where most of the world's wealth was concentrated. there was little competition on the global economic stage when the baby boomers were kids so it became common for people to start amassing wealth, property (houses and cars) and starting families when they were really young because money and high paying jobs grew on trees (compared to now). today this trend is being reversed in a big way as the economic bubble has popped and the rest of the world has caught up. edit: typos",cup2arp,367.74278703843794,1,1441271413,61,15,4686,0,53.943967775865374,581.0,825.0,18.0,3,0.05555555555555555,0.05555555555555555,0.1111111111111111,0.7222222222222222,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.16666666666666666,0.0,1.388888888888889,0.03776844070961718,0.25989672977624784,0.0,0,0.0,591,67.32,57.39,88.12,47.69,31.11,14.72,90.52,52.45,11.17,6.43,3.21,0.68,0.17,0.00,2.37,4.74,6.94,14.21,8.29,7.11,7.28,1.52,15.40,5.08,3.38,1.86,1.52,4.23,2.88,2.03,0.85,0.00,0.34,0.17,9.81,1.02,0.00,0.00,0.00,11.84,1.86,1.86,1.02,3.72,0.68,4.06,1.69,0.51,0.68,0.17,2.54,0.34,1.02,0.00,0.85,6.77,2.03,1.02,2.88,0.68,0.34,4.74,9.14,0.34,19.97,2.03,11.17,6.77,4.06,0.68,0.34,1.52,0.00,0.17,0.34,0.00,0.00,0.17,0.17,0.00,15.57,3.05,3.38,0.17,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.51,1.02,0.85,4.74,1.86

t3_3a2kst,"i will repost a reply i made to the very article you posted which line up with your views: ------------------------- the article was terrible, i will go through each point individually. male/female brains: there are differences between male and female brains which is caused by differences in hormones absorbed by the brain when the baby is still in the womb, this is scientific fact, i can provide a lot of proof for this, including genes which are responsible for the differences between trans men and women's brains. even if this was not the case, there is something biologically/in the brain/something which makes gender identity innate much like sexuality is, despite there being no biological evidence sexuality is innate/biological it is still taken as not a choice and something people are born as, it is the same thing for gender identity. to me the brain sex differences in trans men and woman is more the cause of the dysphoria not necessarily their identity as a man/woman and therefore should not really count as a ""this is a woman"". what the female/male brain does not mean that gender constructs are innate, there is no innate gender construct and has nothing to do with differences in brains, women are not bad at maths and the female/male brain is meaningless to this ridiculous notion. anyone that uses the female/male brain science to say women are inferior to men, the person saying it is the problem not the science behind it. in the same way women being the ones who give birth does not mean they are incapable of getting a job and must stay at home, anyone who says that are called out on their beliefs but the science behind the biological differences are never called our or questioned so why should it be the same with brain differences, call the person out not the science. woman=life experience not identity. if a woman is her life experiences, and specificity according to the author its the sexism women face that makes someone a women. this is wrong in so many ways, would a woman in say saudi arabia who face a lot more discrimination than a women in say norway be more of a woman? would a woman from the future where men and women treated equally not be a woman at all? being who a woman is on experiences which differ so much depending on country/age/race/wealth/many other conditions that makes peoples experiences very unique. the author complains about trans women defining a woman for themselves means they they are defining what a woman is for all women while at the same time defining what a woman is by saying a women is a women because of experiences, which is incredibly hypocritical, to put it simply if you identify as a woman you are a woman, it is as simple as that. if trans women identifying as a women undermines other women's identity's then gay marriage undermines straight marriage because they are both equally ridiculous. tl;dr, brain sex is a thing but does not mean social gender constructs are anything other than just silly constructs, it is just the cause of gender dysphoria in trans men and women. a women is a woman if she identifies as one, other peoples justification of a women has no relevance to anyone but themselves. sorry if it is a little badly worded it is 11pm here. ------------------------- you say mtf trans people are all into ultra feminine things, some are and others aren't, i am a trans women, i do not wear make-up, i do not care about fashion i pretty much wear jeans and a t-shirt, i didn't transition to do ""girly"" things, i transitioned to get rid of dysphoria and to be my true self.",cs8otu7,293.1636904937749,1,1434485842,81,28,987,0,42.082994417862864,627.0,959.0,18.0,2,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.2777777777777778,0.7777777777777778,0.0,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.05555555555555555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16666666666666666,0.0,1.388888888888889,0.18858384982952459,0.19776714513556617,0.0,0,0.0,643,63.82,69.61,20.33,14.94,35.72,15.71,89.42,55.37,12.60,4.35,1.87,0.16,0.78,0.31,1.24,8.24,9.64,11.66,10.89,3.73,6.38,3.27,15.71,7.31,4.51,2.49,0.16,2.80,2.33,0.78,1.56,0.00,0.31,0.31,16.02,0.47,0.00,6.84,1.71,15.55,2.49,2.33,1.87,3.27,1.56,6.69,2.02,0.16,1.09,0.00,4.82,2.80,0.62,0.93,0.00,2.64,0.62,0.16,1.09,0.47,0.47,1.56,12.29,0.62,7.15,0.47,5.13,1.71,1.87,0.00,0.16,0.16,0.16,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,18.82,2.49,4.04,0.31,0.16,0.31,0.00,8.09,0.62,0.78,0.00,2.02

t3_2weoiv,"let me try a business perspective to answer this. they are running a marketing campaign. marketing is an expense that aims to create more value than it costs. you are only looking at the cost side. reddit is a great product that users love. a major part of their monetization strategy relies on users buying reddit gold. while there are benefits of reddit gold, the product positioning of reddit gold is strongly tied to a feeling - a feeling that you are supporting a product you love, feeling like you are part of a community, feeling like you are helping keep reddit free of intrusive advertising. giving some of their advertising revenue to non-profits is a great marketing tactic to help build and reinforce those good feelings to existing users. and it is important to keep in mind that all users are potential customers. if reddit were a chinese buffet, we as users are people that walked in the door and are looking at the food. we may not have bought anything yet, but we are eying the orange chicken and drooling. the chinese buffet will spend money on giving us a sample for free in hopes of reinforcing what you believe (the food is delicious) and encouraging you to pony up your money to eat. reddit's approach is a little less direct, but matches their product, audience and goals nicely. like a free sample, reddit's charity campaign reinforces that feeling we believe about reddit (it's a community, it is a good place) in hopes of pushing people over the edge to buy reddit gold. maybe not today, or tomorrow, but the next time you think about giving gold, you will remember that reddit gave money to charity, and that may help some people decide to buy. if it is a success, reddit will: (1) reinforce the good feeling people have about the site, (2) grow its user base (and, therefore, its potential customer base) through people encouraging friends to vote, and ultimately (3) increase long-term revenue from gold subscriptions. not every marketing campaign is a success, so only reddit will be able to evaluate if this earned more money than they spent (donated) and if it should be repeated.",coq799l,275.27802101355303,1,1424338676,16,5,9359,0,58.544942140790766,366.0,547.0,17.0,1,0.0,0.058823529411764705,0.23529411764705882,0.23529411764705882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11764705882352941,0.0,0.6470588235294118,0.08534653663330134,0.2540983606557377,0.0,0,0.0,371,76.81,84.08,15.16,99.00,21.82,21.56,88.68,47.98,11.32,5.66,0.27,1.35,2.70,0.00,1.35,5.66,7.82,11.86,9.16,2.96,5.66,0.81,18.06,3.50,2.43,0.27,0.81,2.96,8.36,8.36,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,10.51,0.00,0.27,0.00,0.00,12.94,4.04,1.62,1.89,4.31,0.54,3.50,3.77,1.08,0.00,1.89,1.89,0.27,0.00,0.00,1.08,10.78,3.77,2.70,2.43,3.23,0.27,2.16,10.24,2.43,8.89,1.62,5.12,2.16,5.12,3.77,0.27,8.09,0.00,0.00,3.50,0.00,3.50,0.00,0.00,0.00,15.36,4.58,5.12,0.27,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.81,0.00,0.81,3.77,0.00

t3_369qzj,"i think you have got good intentions, but i see a few flaws in this plan. firstly, while it is nice to think we could remove money from politics altogether or offset it with systems like this, the expenses involved in a major political campaign are massive. all of the advertising involved, booking locations for speeches, printing electioneering materials, etc... it costs a lot. so a lot of money is going to be involved no matter what we do, really. now, as to your system, you have said that the top two parties will receive equal funding... which undermines the entire point of having a parliamentary system as you do in the uk. you would end up basically creating republicans vs democrats as we have over here in america, with little to no chance of third parties making it into the legislature. i am not sure if that's necessarily what you want. personally, i am fond of what you have over there in terms of making a more diverse set of ideologies as representatives. i am not sure you have mastered the system yet, but it is better than our two parties. next, you have divided up the funding by memberships, which to me sounds like it could be easily abused by everyone pooling to one side. if a very conservative group decided to pull everyone into their party, they would suddenly get a majority of the funding, so it solves nothing. you have set a minimum number of members to a party, which to me sounds very exclusionary to third parties, referring back to the above two party consequences... so as i said, i think you have got the right intentions, but money is always something complicated and sought after, and it is going to take a much more thought out and debated system to do anything useful. and the biggest issue with that is, the people making this system would be the same legislators who are receiving the money... conflict of interests. if anything, you would want to create a third party institution outside of the political arena, run hopefully by the people in a way that does not allow politicians to entice them, and this institution collects all the funding and distributes it evenly to every political nominee. even my system would have flaws and need to be fleshed out, but the biggest issue will always be trying to make an institution which is unbiased that handles the distribution of money.",crc1o7x,397.824687457185,1,1431885055,114,17,3748,0,53.11868421052634,414.0,644.0,19.0,44,0.0,0.0,0.3684210526315789,0.3157894736842105,0.0,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.10526315789473684,0.0,0.8947368421052629,0.05241826075159409,0.24154589371980675,0.0,0,0.0,414,73.77,74.30,17.78,95.00,21.79,20.53,88.65,56.76,14.49,7.00,2.42,0.97,2.90,0.00,0.72,7.49,8.21,15.46,9.90,3.62,5.80,1.45,16.67,6.28,4.11,1.93,1.93,3.14,5.07,4.83,0.24,0.00,0.24,0.00,10.14,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,15.70,2.17,2.66,3.38,2.90,3.14,3.62,1.69,0.48,1.21,0.00,0.24,0.24,0.00,0.00,0.00,11.11,3.62,1.93,4.35,1.45,0.48,1.69,10.63,1.45,10.63,1.69,6.52,3.14,2.42,2.42,0.00,2.66,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,13.04,6.52,6.28,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.24,0.00,0.00

""was getting that tattoo on my hand really a great idea?"" ""was taking that year off school really a great idea?"" ""was getting married and having three kids by 22 a great idea?"" your parents are totally right as far as changing when you get older, and they know because they went through the same damn thing at the same age. the only difference is that they wound up in the religious community. --- that said... you'll probably still be living in san francisco, still be openly bi, in poly relationships (poly/open ftw, btw), and probably agnostic or even atheist. also, you will be able to make a lot more wise decisions in life and see both sides in arguments and be able to change your own view based on new evidence without feeling like you 'lost'. --- i'm 32. when i was 19, i had all these great ideas about how everything should work and how i was going to propose these ideas and revolutionize the world. i hit 25 and realized that most people would rather watch someone starve to death than pay 0.5% higher tax to feed them. i hit 25 and realized that getting laid is not the end-goal in life. i hit 25 and realized that making $15,000 per year potentially leads to a richer life experience than making $100,000 per year. (at $100,000, who needs real friends, you can just hire one.) this is all part of the first had experience of when your brain makes it is final change around the age of 25. this sudden clarity is a very real thing and is actually based in biology. you'll still be you, just smarter. your family believes that this will lead to you wisening up and being... what is the word? heteronormative? whatever. and part of their religious community. even if that's not true. even if your way of life, which sounds fucking awesome, btw, is just a phase, who cares? you would move back home. if it is not a phase, you stay there. so long as you are happy, that's all that really truly matters.",cqxbpip,300.5577469963083,1,1430719863,24,10,11957,0,76.5988011434082,427.0,593.0,34.0,7,0.029411764705882353,0.0,0.14705882352941177,0.058823529411764705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23529411764705882,0.02525252525252525,0.25526932084309134,0.0,0,0.0,448,39.21,71.91,77.06,67.93,13.58,14.06,90.18,54.24,15.85,8.26,2.68,0.00,4.46,0.00,1.12,7.59,5.13,12.05,9.38,8.04,7.14,1.12,18.08,7.59,4.24,2.46,4.69,2.90,4.02,3.12,0.89,0.00,0.67,0.22,9.82,0.67,0.22,0.00,0.00,17.19,4.46,3.57,2.01,2.68,2.23,4.24,2.46,0.89,0.45,0.45,3.35,0.67,1.56,0.45,0.45,8.04,1.56,2.01,2.68,2.23,0.22,3.35,9.38,1.79,16.07,2.46,8.04,6.25,2.01,0.22,0.45,0.67,0.67,0.22,1.34,0.45,0.67,0.22,0.00,0.00,20.98,6.92,5.36,0.00,0.00,1.34,0.00,1.79,1.34,2.01,0.89,1.34
t3_3cgwcw,"in your analogy, the guy who hacks off his own leg is permanently crippled. he may regret his decision but there is nothing he can do about it, his leg is still gone. he can't get it back no matter how much he tries, it is just gone. being obese (in most cases) is not just a 'well they did it to themself' but rather the result of an ongoing series of self-destructive choices ('they are continuing to do it to themself'). the obese person (generally) only stays obese through a continued lifestyle of bad diet and low exercise. this is a choice they make every time they pick up a mclardburger. if the obese person improved their diet and started exercising, their weight would improve and they would no longer be disabled. therefore, we can say that an obese person is *continually choosing to be disabled* and thus should not be afforded the same benefits as someone who does not have a choice. let me make an analogy here- **let's say i tied a rope around my legs and handcuffed myself behind my back. i then claim that i am disabled** and i need a wheelchair and someone to push me around and spoon feed me because i am unable to do these things. **would you support spending tens of thousands of dollars to pay for my wheelchair and an aide?** no of course not, because i am only 'disabled' by choice and i can choose to become un-disabled whenever i want. therefore while my present situation may require accommodations, *by choosing not to correct that situation i am also choosing to require those accommodations*. this is little different than parking in a handicap spot because i am too lazy to walk across the parking lot- handicap accommodations are for people who are handicapped by illness or injury, not people who choose to reduce their own capabilities. the correct solution for someone like this not to spend $10k+ on wheelchairs and aides and whatnot, it is to give them the tools they need to improve their own situations- a handcuff key and a pair of scissors will do nicely. or if you want to go really hands on, un-handcuff them and then cut the rope for them. ----- **let's take a couple of similar analogies to illustrate.** my job involves just talking on the phone, and i am really really lazy. i sit in bed all day talking on the phone, never moving an inch. as a result my muscles atrophy and i am now extremely weak. do i have the right to demand that self-closing doors have their tension reduced because i am otherwise too weak to open them? it's the middle of summer, and i show up somewhere wearing a thick winter parka. i complain that it is too hot and i demand the ac be turned up. i refuse to take off my parka because it is my right to wear the parka, but my overheating will cause me medical problems therefore i need accommodation. is this reasonable? no of course not because i am creating a problem and demanding other people fix it (even when i can fix it for myself cheaper and faster). if i drink too much at a party, and i am still drunk or very hung over the next day and i can't do my job, should i be able to claim medical disability leave and get a paid day off? no of course not, because the only reason i am unable to work is because i made irresponsible bad choices the night before. if i do a bunch of drugs and show up to work fucked up, and my manager fires me, should i be able to claim discrimination against a disabled person because my manager discriminated against my disability? no of course not, because any 'disability' i have is the direct result of irresponsible bad choices. if i get addicted and i have a continual habit of drug or alcohol abuse, should i demand special accommodation from my employer because of a disability?

should i demand a free scooter from the government due to 'disability'? should i demand airlines give me two seats instead of one (but without charging me extra)? why should i get these accommodations if someone who's 'disabled' due to drinking or drugs (also choices, just like food) does not get those accommodations?

t3_3apczi,"this comment isn't like the rest of this thread. most of these can be summed up as ""eugenics are wrong hitler are wrong you are hitler dieeeee"". this is not that kind of comment, knowing that please read further. eugenics are wrong? whoever thinks that is extremely close-minded, the only valid argument against eugenics is the risk that it would pose for a group to decide the future of all humans, everything is else is just religious crap or godwin's law. eugenics is great, our genes worked great once but now they are incredibly outdated, it is like trying to run skyrim on windows 95, it is not going to work well. eugenics could eliminate anything from genetical diseases and push our lifespan beyond the 120 telomere barrier to eliminating pointless hormonally-triggered violence and improving the intelligence of the population. now your problem is the following (other than most likely there is not a ""gay gene"" but rather some weird interaction of genes that have that effect), homosexuality is inferior to heterosexuality because it limits which people you find attractive to from 45% of the population (ie the 90% of the opposite gender that is straight/bi) to just 5% (ie the 10% of the same gender that is homosexual/bi). everything else such as weird anatomical stuff and not being able to have children in a conventional way is not that bad as homosexual sex is about as pleasurable as heterosexual one and artificial insemination and surrogate mothers can solve the problem of having children almost entirely. consequently, homosexuality is bad because it limits the number of available partners, but do you know what is almost as bad? *heterosexuality*. fuck that crap, bisexuals have it all, they can sleep with men and women alike, they can both enjoy the 90% from the opposite sex and then 10% from their same gender, they can enjoy both genders and experience the sensations that both genders experience, they are just *objectively* superior. it does not matter how much hentai you watch or how many people of the same sex you try to sleep with, the fact is that to some extent sexual orientation is genetical and you can't change it. having a bisexual genetical profile is a genetical advantage (not necessarily an evolutive one that's why it is not more common) as it allows people to feel attracted to more people without any downside. and thus, if we find a gay gene we should eliminate it, and if we find a straight gene we should obliterate it too, and instead put a bisexual gene in its place. god i wish being bisexual was a choice but i can't, so i will have to stick with the opposite sex i suppose, darn my luck, but it could be worse.",cseq9zw,384.10604225538725,1,1434983654,230,55,4152,0,45.81276315789475,456.0,712.0,16.0,1,0.0625,0.125,0.4375,0.375,0.0,0.0,0.0625,0.0625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1875,0.0625,0.0,1.375,0.04715083649294176,0.26096491228070173,0.0,0,0.0,467,45.57,49.14,11.90,11.80,29.19,20.77,84.58,53.53,13.49,5.14,1.07,1.28,1.50,0.00,1.28,8.35,6.64,10.71,11.35,4.71,7.28,2.57,14.78,7.07,4.28,1.28,2.36,3.43,6.64,2.78,3.85,0.21,0.86,0.21,8.14,0.21,0.21,0.43,0.21,17.56,2.36,2.57,2.36,3.85,1.71,6.64,1.07,0.21,0.00,0.43,4.93,1.07,0.21,3.64,0.00,8.78,1.93,2.14,1.71,0.86,2.36,0.64,13.06,1.07,6.21,1.28,3.64,1.07,0.86,0.00,0.21,0.00,0.43,0.00,1.07,0.86,0.00,0.00,0.21,0.00,14.56,3.00,4.50,0.00,0.00,0.43,0.00,0.43,0.86,1.07,1.71,2.57

t3_302atl,"you have to put youself into hank's shoes: 1. hank personally witnessed bill's divorce destroy bill and left him a broken shell of a man. the thing is that as pathetic as bill was in the present, bill was not always such a loser back then. dale, from the show's flashbacks, was already portrayed as incompetent, unstable, and well, dale. bill became a fuckup because of the divorce while dale was already a fuckup since high school, if not earlier. hank probably thought that if a normal person could be reduced to a fuckup because of a divorce, imagine how much more a fuckup would sink lower, which is a likely possibility if dale learned that nancy was cheating on him. 2. remember that episode where peggy lost her shit because hank got mono from some random chick back at high school? it was an overreaction because hank kissing that chick ruined some romantic fantasy that peggy had over how she and hank first met or something. and if there is one person who blows things even more out of proportion and overreacts to minor things, it is dale gribble. 3. dale is highly suspicious of anyone, and the few people he trusts are nancy and hank. but the thing is that he trusts that they both have his best intentions at heart, not that he literally believes everything they say. it is very likely that even if hank told dale, dale would refuse to believe hank, think that hank is telling a joke or not being serious, or believe in any other cognitive dissonant thoughts because as far as dale is concerned, nancy will never harm him. i mean, dale already knows that he is not joseph's biological dad and that john redcorn was alone with nancy on the day that she got pregnant. part of me thinks that dale only believed that aliens inpregnate nancy because the truth of nancy's infidelity would destroy him emotionally. in the end of the episode, dale mostly played along with joseph's suggestion that dale might be his biological father instead of aliens because of reasons. hank probably figured that dale will never believe him anyways. 4. hank might judge people harshly, but he does not impose his values onto other people and rarely interfers with other people's lives. it is not his personality. he does not try to push strickland away from his hedonic lifestyle, he does not try to make cotton not be a bitter old racist, misogynist asshole, and for all his grips over bobby not being right, he does not really micromanage bobby or force bobby to be into sports or anything else that would make bobby ""right."" hank's tolerance of lifestyle that 100% goes against his values is contrasted with peggy's constant attempts at trying to meddle into other people's affairs even though she is ostentatiously tolerant of other people's lifestyles.",cponldu,2492.5170750621432,1,1427165741,52,12,-11803,0,59.37161451700929,478.0,714.0,23.0,5,0.043478260869565216,0.0,0.17391304347826086,0.13043478260869565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13043478260869565,0.0,0.4782608695652174,0.11873770169224712,0.2489539748953975,0.0,0,0.0,483,40.66,54.14,11.75,19.58,21.00,19.88,79.92,52.80,14.08,6.00,0.41,0.00,0.21,4.97,0.41,8.07,4.76,10.77,8.90,5.38,8.07,2.90,15.73,4.55,2.07,1.04,1.45,2.07,6.42,2.90,3.31,0.21,1.24,1.24,11.59,1.24,0.00,1.24,4.76,19.67,3.73,3.11,2.07,5.80,1.24,7.04,0.62,0.00,0.21,0.21,1.86,0.83,0.62,0.21,0.00,5.80,0.62,1.86,3.11,0.62,0.41,4.76,8.70,1.04,9.73,0.62,5.59,3.93,1.04,0.83,0.00,0.83,0.00,0.00,0.83,0.41,0.00,0.00,0.21,0.21,12.63,4.55,4.76,0.21,0.00,0.21,0.00,0.00,0.41,2.28,0.00,0.21

t3_33x4zd,"with regards to a dangerous hobby, the legal principle of 'volenti non fit injuria' applies: 'to he who consents, no harm is done'. however, as in most things, there is more to be considered. i fail to see the connection between tragedy and sympathy. sympathy (*syn* - together, *pathos* - feeling) is a reaction to the distress or need of another human being. if the person is dead, how can they have a need or be in distress? in these cases i would argue that what is meant by the term 'sympathy' in these cases is feeling of pity for the family and friends of the deceased, as opposed to the deceased themselves, which is something independent of the cause of the death. in this way, any death invokes a sympathetic response for those who were closed to the person. with regards to the term tragedy, this is when the misfortune of one person invokes a catharsis in those observing, particularly a cleansing of pity and fear. i do not see this being strictly relevant in the case of a thrill-seeker meeting their maker unexpectedly, but this may be due to the public inaccurate use of language. you mention when someone takes up a clearly risky hobby. in many cases all we know is that a *hazard* exists, but this is not necessarily a *risk* as we do not always know the most likely (or maximal) outcome, or how likely these outcomes are. people attempt to estimate the risk, however we are famously bad at this. once we have made an estimate, we will do one or more of the four: * avoid the risk altogether: we feel that the risk is too high, and it should not be embarked on. this is my position with most risky hobbies, but not everyone feels the same way; * reduce the risk: some will undergo training, buy better equipment, research the activity etc. they recognise that the risk is high, so they attempt to reduce the possible outcome, the likelihood of occurrence, or both; * transfer the risk: usually through insurance, people try to make the impact lower by transferring the liability to another body. does not help if you are dead, however, unless you take out an on-death policy before the activity, which is highly suspicious! * accept the risk: usually after attempting to reduce it, the person feels the risk is now low enough to accept. this last point is where problems creep in. did the person have all the data, statistics, and knowledge before they accepted the risk? often we 'accept without knowledge', accepting a risk that is above what is reasonable as they do not have a proper feel for what the risk is. in this case 'volenti non fit injuria' does not apply: this principle requires a full knowledge and extent of the risk. i feel sympathy for a person injured in an accident when undertaking a risky hobby (not when they are killed: then i sympathise with the family, as mentioned above), but like you i feel less pity/sympathy for someone who has been injured/killed where the risk was fully known and quantified, and the extent known... and then they did it anyway. with regards to your final point about employment, i agree wholeheartedly, and in uk case law the principle of 'volenti non fit injuria' is often not applicable in these cases, as even though the person knows that the risk is part of the job, they often cannot fully consent to the level, and certainly do not consent to harm as part of a breach or failure.",cqq3w8x,296.2784612936605,1,1430134530,131,16,48557,0,54.3326036432161,597.0,898.0,24.0,1,0.0,0.0,0.2916666666666667,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.08333333333333333,0.041666666666666664,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.08333333333333333,0.0,0.9583333333333333,0.09198128526773028,0.21440536013400335,0.0,0,0.0,603,74.51,59.83,44.92,1.00,25.12,19.90,87.89,56.05,11.77,5.14,1.33,1.16,0.83,0.17,1.66,6.63,10.78,13.43,9.29,4.64,7.46,2.32,13.93,4.15,3.32,2.65,0.66,2.65,8.46,1.49,6.97,3.81,0.50,1.49,9.29,0.33,1.16,0.00,0.17,17.25,4.31,2.32,1.33,4.64,1.49,5.14,1.66,0.33,0.00,1.33,1.00,1.00,0.83,0.00,0.00,10.28,2.99,0.66,2.82,0.50,4.31,1.82,10.28,0.83,10.95,0.33,6.97,3.65,1.99,1.00,0.33,0.33,0.00,1.49,0.50,0.00,0.17,0.17,0.00,0.17,18.41,3.81,6.47,1.33,0.33,0.33,0.17,0.66,0.00,1.99,1.00,2.32

[boys] with dogs at their heels and other evidence of dissolute habits...[girls who] drive coal-carts, ride astride upon horses, drink, swear, fight, smoke, whistle, and care for nobody...the morals of children are tenfold worse than formerly. - 1843 > whither are the manly vigor and athletic appearance of our forefathers flown? can these be their legitimate heirs? surely, no; a race of effeminate, self-admiring, emaciated fribbles can never have descended in a direct line from the heroes of potiers and agincourt... - 1771 > ... i find by sad experience how the towns and streets are filled with lewd wicked children, and many children as they have played about the streets have been heard to curse and swear and call one another nick-names, and it would grieve ones heart to hear what bawdy and filthy communications proceeds from the mouths of such... - 1695 > youth were never more sawcie, yea never more savagely saucie . . . the ancient are scorned, the honourable are contemned, the magistrate is not dreaded. - 1624 > the children now love luxury. they have bad manners, contempt for authority; they show disrespect for elders and love chatter in place of exercise. ~ 430 bc every previous generation has been wrong, but *this* time it is for real. edit: and now i spent so long writing this the thread is already finished, i do not even get a participation trophy :( edit 2: i found one of my favorite excerpts from a book. i strongly recommend reading the [section](on tea, it is one of the most hilarious things i have ever read. *cottage economy; containing information relative to the brewing of beer, making of bread, keeping of cows, pigs, bees, ewes, goats, poultry, etc* by william cobbett - 1822 > ""i view the tea drinking as a destroyer of health, an enfeebler of the frame, an engenderer of effeminacy and laziness, a debaucher of youth, and a maker of misery for old age.""",csinn2z,905.8460628781824,1,1435268323,244,46,-19213,0,50.2430283639884,1033.0,1656.0,50.0,6,0.02,0.0,0.06,0.04,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02,0.06,0.0,0.19999999999999998,NaN,0.3639883833494676,0.0,0,0.0,1062,85.41,71.09,19.84,24.28,25.29,24.20,81.26,46.99,9.42,4.24,0.85,0.56,0.09,0.19,2.54,5.18,8.85,12.81,7.72,3.30,5.65,1.32,11.86,4.43,2.07,1.69,1.88,2.54,7.63,3.77,3.86,0.56,1.04,0.85,9.60,0.66,0.09,0.28,0.47,8.19,1.79,0.75,0.38,1.41,2.26,2.35,1.88,1.04,0.28,0.28,3.01,0.85,0.94,0.09,0.94,7.63,2.17,1.51,2.82,1.32,1.04,2.54,8.66,0.56,11.49,1.60,4.71,5.18,1.98,2.73,0.19,0.38,1.04,0.19,0.66,0.19,0.28,0.28,0.00,0.00,21.00,6.78,5.27,0.85,1.04,0.75,0.00,1.79,0.38,0.28,0.28,3.58

[napoleon,](who was a dictatorial and warmongering emperor. the american revolution was followed by peace, the establishment of an actually elected government, and when problems did arise, a peaceful solution in the form of the constitutional convention. the transition from adams to jefferson after the brutally contentious election of 1800 was probably the first peaceful transition of power between political adversaries in a sovereign state the world had seen for over a thousand years. >and american revolution was an overreaction to british enforcement of fair taxes that paid for the 7 years war to protect americans. it was a mutual escalation, with colonial tax protests being met with [excessive reprisals](from the british crown. [many within the british parliament sympathized with the americans](and thought the government was being foolish, even if sentiment was generally that they should not have gone to war. >-industrial revolution: granted high developments in technology and economic prowess were built on slavery, child labor, discrimination against immigrants, poverty and greedy, amoral robber barons and corrupt politicians. i think you are putting a far more negative gloss on this than is justified. first, most of the massive economic growth of the us took place after the civil war, and were not primarily driven by slave labor at any point. second, the effects of that economic growth on human wellbeing across the country today are enormous. standards of living are very high in the us today, and there is no country on earth which has industrialized without having poor labor market conditions in its early industrial period. also, immigrants to america in this era weren't dupes. they moved here because america really did offer opportunity to make a life for yourself that was not available anywhere else in the world at the time. >civil war: the fact that it needed to happen and that a flag that represents those who fought to defend slavery is still being flown and celebrated is disappointing. obviously slavery is a dark mark on american history, and i have nothing to say in its defense, except that the north could have let the south secede, and a major reason that it did not play out that way was a moral opposition to slavery. >world war 2: significant military power, certainly helped turn the tide, still killed 300,000 civilians with atomic weapons and put asian americans in camps (with little reparation that came way too late). again, nothing to say in defense of internment, but will note that the us did not start wwii, and did not fully enter it until it was attacked by the japanese and declared war on by the germans. war is nasty business though, and if you are looking for a war fought by ethical means, you will never find one. >of course there are worse countries in the world, but current day america is a wreck. frequent mass shootings that do not really happen in other developed countries, continued high race tensions, religious fundamentalism in the south and a poor education system. so tell me cmv, is there any reason to celebrate or be proud of my country? current day america has problems, but we are not a wreck. crime is way down, our economic situation is doing much better than most other developed countries, and we still have a reasonably functional government which allows for peaceful political discourse and meaningfully defends americans' civil rights. is it perfect? hell no. is life in contemporary america one of the best places and times in human history to be alive? yes. and that's saying something.",csrkkl3,1000.7574177219004,1,1435977362,85,13,-22227,0,42.110909090909104,705.0,1192.0,33.0,141,0.09090909090909091,0.0,0.21212121212121213,0.24242424242424243,0.0,0.0,0.030303030303030304,0.0,0.030303030303030304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030303030303030304,0.030303030303030304,0.6666666666666665,NaN,0.30354609929078014,0.0,0,0.0,718,81.52,46.66,52.06,2.47,21.76,26.46,84.68,50.14,8.64,2.92,0.70,0.97,0.70,0.00,0.56,5.71,8.64,13.09,9.47,3.34,5.71,2.51,15.04,5.01,1.67,0.97,1.81,1.25,7.38,2.37,5.01,0.14,3.06,0.14,4.87,0.00,0.14,0.00,0.00,9.89,1.81,1.67,1.11,1.53,1.25,4.04,0.84,0.42,0.42,0.00,0.70,0.00,0.70,0.00,0.00,13.09,1.53,2.37,7.80,1.53,1.25,5.85,7.24,0.42,15.88,2.23,8.50,5.29,4.18,0.42,0.14,1.95,0.56,1.67,0.28,0.14,0.00,0.14,0.00,0.00,15.04,3.76,5.01,0.56,0.00,0.70,0.28,0.14,0.00,0.56,1.25,2.79

t3_2yo9k1,"well it depends what you think ""wrong"" is. nobody would argue that it is objectively a bad chord progression. nobody would argue that it has no merit at all. people arguably consider it a cop-out. >why not use it? why not try using something else? can you explain why you are using that progression? is it because you are inexperienced and just want to use something you know will ""work""? in that case, why not use the 12 bar blues, or a i iv i v sequence, or i vii vi v in a minor key? is it because you wrote the melody and realized that it is one of the few chord sequences that sounds ""right"" to you with the melody on top? perhaps other sequences you tried are too out of place when coming after the verse, uncomfortable to play on guitar in the right key, perhaps this is the only chord sequence that can simultaneously harmonize the melody the way you want and contrast with the tonality and ""feel"" of the verse in the way you want. as an example that will make people groan, consider the song ""for the first time in forever"" from frozen. personally i think it is the better song from the soundtrack. the duet at the end of the song is fantastic and kristen bell had a great performance on that recording. they didn't use a i-v-vi-iv chord progression. they did use that progression in the far more popular ""let it go,"" and presumably, even if they wanted that progression, they thought it would be bad to have it in both songs. and i imagine a lot of people would think it would be bad to have it in both songs. and there is the issue many people have with it; it is overused. you can listen to three songs in a row that have that chord progression, and while none of those songs is objectively bad for using that progression, it does make you tired of hearing it. imagine if the songs [comfortably numb](and [hotel california](didn't end when they did. both songs end with long, somewhat legendary guitar solos over the backing of the chord sequences played out during the verse. if those songs carried on for longer i believe it wouldn't be as good. do i think gilmour and felder could have played some more amazing solo work for a little while? yes. do i think eventually they would run out of ideas for stuff to play in those solos? yes. this is very much like what happens with this i v vi iv progression; it has been done so much that many of the best ideas have been explored. most of the time when you use this progression, you are scraping the barrel for what interesting melodies are left. **it is not using what is best, or even close to best. it is using what is good enough, what is satisfactory. it is settling for far, far less than perfection, and that is what many people do not like about it**. i could try rewriting *[dies irae](so that the melody fit a i v vi iv progression, but i doubt it would make it better. or perhaps *[sound an alarm](or *[london calling](or *[never going to give you up](but it wouldn't make any of them better. and you really have to question whether it makes your song better to include it. maybe it does, and if so, then go ahead and use that in whatever way you would like. but there are so many interesting ways to write music that it would be a shame to not explore them. i am not expecting you to revolutionise music and drive the creation of a new genre or art form like beethoven or the sugarhill gang or whatever. i think though, if you are making music for your own pleasure, you would enjoy it a lot more if you tried something more original, less common, etc. and made it work. at the end of the day though, unless you are feeding your kids with music, it is entirely your thing. you are doing it for you, and if i v vi iv is what you want to do, then you should do that. just consider that it is not what is best, that there are other ideas worth exploring, that music is about creating and discovering and most importantly, loving what you make. edit: i split the first paragraph after the quote into two and added a little bit about two different chord sequences",cpbhs8l,1094.4656780799562,1,1426092260,23,10,9427,0,73.60605891371003,761.0,1033.0,42.0,2,0.0,0.023809523809523808,0.09523809523809523,0.14285714285714285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023809523809523808,0.0,0.023809523809523808,0.11904761904761904,0.0,0.4285714285714286,NaN,0.19448094612352168,0.0,0,0.0,771,34.18,58.21,33.34,79.99,17.93,12.97,89.36,58.37,18.55,7.26,2.20,0.00,4.02,0.00,1.04,11.28,6.61,10.89,10.89,4.54,7.65,2.08,18.42,4.80,3.37,2.59,0.91,3.63,6.10,4.54,1.56,0.52,0.39,0.00,7.39,0.00,0.13,0.00,0.00,17.77,3.37,3.76,3.63,4.54,0.65,5.06,3.11,0.00,2.85,0.26,1.04,0.00,0.78,0.00,0.26,5.32,0.26,2.85,1.43,1.69,0.91,2.46,13.23,1.17,11.41,1.30,5.97,4.02,0.91,3.37,0.00,0.13,0.00,0.13,0.39,0.00,0.00,0.26,0.13,0.00,15.95,4.41,4.02,0.13,0.26,1.04,0.00,0.52,1.56,0.52,0.78,2.72
t3_3dk4k6,"napoleon had very little chance of conquering europe even if he had won at waterloo. there was another massive russian/austrian army on the way to join the british and the prussians. almost all of europe was fairly united in their opposition to napoleon and you cannot wage war against an entire continent, no matter how good of a general you are. add the fact that many of the reasons that were behind napoleon's earlier successes were no longer present - the allies had reformed their armies, were coordinating their operations better, and learned from their previous mistakes. france, on the other hand, was drained of its manpower and was economically exhausted. in short, napoleon's chances of rebuilding his empire were very slim. at best, he would be embroiled in continuous game of wack-a-mole where one part or another rebelled. it would be an unending war with hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of casualties. that aside, the article is extremely generous to napoleon, more than he deserves. napoleon crowned himself emperor - hardly a republican thing to do. he invaded countries or threatened them with invasion to make them comply with his demands. he installed his family members and close associates as kings and dukes of conquered territories. he forced conquered peoples to pay him taxes to fund his next campaigns and enforced the continental blockade against their will. you can't really frame the napoleonic wars as ones of republicanism vs monarchism. britain was a constitutional monarchy and was staunchly against napoleon. in spain, napoleon faced a national uprising against his rule (or rather napoleon's brother whom he tried to install as king). saying that napoleon wanted peace in 1805 or 1809 is a bit disingenuous. saddam hussein also wanted peace after conquering kuwait. does that make the united states and the un forced that launched operation desert storm in 1991 the aggressors? hitler didn't want war with great britain and france after he invaded poland in 1939. they declared war on germany - are they the aggressors? why should we take 1805 or 1809 as the baseline? you have to consider the context.",ct68k3i,1864.8365370145548,1,1437111740,26,5,22143,0,50.855217391304365,345.0,574.0,23.0,1,0.21739130434782608,0.0,0.08695652173913043,0.13043478260869565,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.08695652173913043,0.043478260869565216,0.6086956521739131,0.04242424242424242,0.3565217391304348,0.0,0,0.0,354,75.74,72.34,1.70,17.55,15.39,27.97,78.25,50.28,11.86,8.19,0.00,0.28,1.13,4.24,2.54,3.67,6.78,14.12,7.91,3.67,6.50,1.69,12.15,5.08,3.39,1.13,2.82,2.54,5.65,2.54,3.11,0.28,2.54,0.00,11.86,0.56,0.00,0.00,5.37,13.28,1.13,2.54,2.82,3.11,1.13,5.65,0.56,0.00,0.28,0.28,1.13,0.28,0.85,0.00,0.00,12.43,2.26,2.54,7.91,2.26,0.28,6.50,5.37,0.28,8.47,0.28,6.50,1.69,2.54,0.56,0.28,1.41,0.00,1.69,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,13.56,5.65,2.82,0.00,0.00,0.85,0.00,1.41,0.00,1.41,1.13,0.28

""based on a true story"" does not mean (and has never meant) historical accuracy. it means ""we didn't come up with the basis for this story, and we have paid someone for the rights to use *their* story as the basis for our film instead"". notice the difference in the disclaimers at the beginning of most films ('based on a true story' flashing onscreen for a few seconds) compared to *tora! tora! tora!* (which takes like 3 minutes to go over their attempts at accuracy). i think the larger failing in your primary example is not that ""historical fiction"" about the cold war was used as the basis for your history class, it is that education should be less about dumping information into student's heads, and more about teaching them to acquire and critically evaluate the information they do receive.",crb48sd,732.2530577812128,1,1431796842,37,13,2521,0,58.74029411764707,408.0,631.0,24.0,4,0.0,0.0,0.16666666666666666,0.08333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25,0.13330759181142812,0.27450980392156865,0.0,0,0.0,412,85.28,74.40,32.07,12.81,19.62,20.87,86.41,50.73,11.89,5.10,0.24,1.21,1.94,0.49,1.21,6.80,8.50,16.50,7.52,4.37,6.07,0.97,16.50,7.04,4.85,2.18,0.97,2.43,2.91,0.97,1.94,0.00,1.21,0.24,8.50,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.49,19.66,3.64,4.37,2.18,3.64,3.88,3.64,2.67,1.21,0.49,0.97,0.24,0.24,0.00,0.00,0.00,6.55,1.70,1.21,3.64,0.49,0.24,4.13,10.44,0.24,13.35,1.94,7.04,4.61,2.91,2.18,0.24,0.24,0.00,0.24,0.24,0.24,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,23.79,4.37,3.64,0.24,0.00,1.46,1.46,0.49,3.16,2.18,4.37,2.43

t3_37e6il,"from this site: helmets head injuries going up with increased helmet usage. between 1991 and 2001 two things happened: helmet use among cyclists soared, and head injuries soared along with it. head injuries among cyclists went up by 10% on a simple basis, but when we factor in the dramatic decrease in the number of cyclists during that period, head injuries effectively went up by 51%. (new york times, 2001) incidentally, from this we can figure that there was a 27% reduction in cycling. (e.g., 1000 injuries + 10% = 1100 injuries; 1100 injuries ? 1.51 = 728 injuries; 1000 to 728 is a ~27% reduction.) head injuries didn't go up because helmets turned would-be fatalities into simple injuries. one reader complained that the reason that head injuries went up as helmet use went up was that fewer cyclists died as a result of wearing helmets, and those who didn't die were simply injured instead, making the head injury stats go up. it is a nice theory, but it is dead wrong. cyclist fatalities have shot straight up with increased helmet use, just as cycling injuries have. cyclist deaths went from 843 to 728 from 1991 to 2001. (traffic safety facts 2001, pdf, p. 17) however, as per the nyt article above, the number of people biking went down 27% during this period, so we would expect the 843 deaths in 1991 to shrink to 615 deaths in 2001 even without increased helmet use. but as helmet use surged, deaths didn't drop to 615, they actually went to 728. that's effectively an 18% increase in the number of cycling deaths as helmet use surged. and for those who complain that we can't look at specific years because of year-to-year variance, let us compare the five-year-average number of deaths from 1987-1991 and 1997-2001. that gives us 879 to 750 deaths, or an effective increase in biking deaths of 17% as helmet use surged. helmet use went from 18% in 1991 to 50% in 2008.

t3_3isviu,"this is becoming increasingly one part of many facets of the military. today, we spend an extraordinary amount of time trying to combat terrorism in its many forms across the world. sure, if you are engaging in counterinsurgency strategy, killing people and breaking things so your desired faction gets an advantage is one method you can employ. it is a quick surge (no, not necessarily *that* surge) of military power to tip the scales, giving your preferred ""team"" the advantage. if you are adopting or transitioning to a counterterrorism strategy, however, this will often involve outreach to the local population and its leaders; providing security; offering resources such as food and clothing, and; generally trying to create conditions that will lower the fear factor of local populations caving to terrorists and heighten the personal investment in building up local communities. we found this out the hard way during the early stages of iraq, obliterating the enemy but also obliterating civilians and their homes as well. even ignoring humanitarian outcries, this makes it far easier for terrorists to make physical incursions since local populations are vulnerable and scared, and thus more likely to acquiesce to their demands. it makes it easier for ""emotional"" incursions, because you have a whole generation sympathetic to parties who are going to kill the people and break the things that killed their families and broke their things. in contrast, we saw way more gains when our military began taking up a police function. it still had traditional military characteristics, including the realistic ability and legal authority to kill and break things when necessary, but it also adopted a more security/rebuilding role, trying to keep streets safe for people and commerce while providing training, building and resources. if i wanted to explore the issue further, i would go so far as to say the best anti-terrorism strategy is going to strongly resemble a nation-building strategy. it takes time and dedication that most leaders of democratic nations will not be able to muster for the long haul, but that's neither here nor there. the fact remains that modern military hurdles have expanded beyond showing up on a physical field of battle and trying to outgun the other guys -- which, if we are being honest, is a *vast* oversimplification of historical warfare, and is yet another reason to be skeptical of huckabee's military acumen. it is choice phrasing designed to be blunt and appeal to folks who view the military as a cosmetic addition to america's display of strength. it is not an accurate framing of any military's role, particularly not one like ours that is contributing to such a wide spectrum of international causes, even if we are ultimately there in some form for our (proactive) defense.",cujddsn,429.8851205522876,1,1440819648,39,12,1968,0,31.274039215686287,459.0,784.0,15.0,72,0.13333333333333333,0.06666666666666667,0.6,0.4,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.0,0.2,0.06666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.06666666666666667,0.0,1.6666666666666667,0.011054421768707483,0.33769063180827885,0.0,0,0.0,462,71.49,75.58,19.32,22.42,30.80,26.84,85.50,49.78,11.04,4.33,0.43,1.73,1.30,0.00,0.87,6.71,6.93,13.20,6.28,4.98,8.87,1.52,11.26,6.28,3.25,1.08,0.65,2.60,8.44,3.90,4.11,1.52,1.52,0.43,9.52,0.43,0.43,0.00,0.22,11.26,1.52,2.16,1.95,3.68,1.30,3.68,1.30,0.87,0.22,0.22,0.65,0.00,0.43,0.00,0.22,13.85,3.25,4.11,5.84,1.73,0.87,1.30,6.93,1.08,12.12,1.08,6.93,3.68,2.16,0.65,0.43,0.43,0.00,1.08,0.22,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.22,0.00,13.64,3.25,5.19,0.00,0.65,0.00,0.00,0.87,0.87,0.87,0.87,1.08

t3_39gzr7,"in my experience there are two ways people solve jigsaw puzzles. one way is your way: they match shapes and colors on the pieces themselves and build the puzzle that way. the other way is my way: we use the patterns on the pieces to figure out where they go in the larger picture (using the box). i get a lot of enjoyment doing it my way. in any decent puzzle placing figuring out where individual pieces fit in the larger picture is challenging. you get a piece that has some brown but a little blue and a grainy texture and you have to figure out where in the picture you can find those three things. and the fact that good puzzle-makers design their cuts to break up recognizable features indicates to me that they do not consider this technique cheating. it is part of the fun! also, i always do puzzles in groups and these two strategies are complementary. my sister is very good at doing things your way and i am good at my way. she ends up doing a lot of work very quickly while i get to puzzle over the trickier pieces. doing it my way you also get to know the picture well! this pleases me because i love looking at pictures. of course, both ways have their weaknesses, and can be more or less effective depending on the puzzle. in fact, your way may actually be more effective in general, but it is definitely not the only way to enjoy a puzzle.",cs3agsc,266.9554537941081,1,1434049447,20,10,1929,0,74.28165116279072,258.0,351.0,15.0,9,0.13333333333333333,0.0,0.13333333333333333,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.06984126984126983,0.2364341085271318,0.0,0,0.0,259,60.98,59.15,92.70,89.97,17.27,13.90,94.21,55.98,16.60,10.81,5.02,0.39,2.70,0.39,2.32,5.79,8.11,11.97,8.88,4.63,5.79,0.77,13.13,3.86,2.32,1.16,1.54,5.79,5.41,4.63,0.77,0.00,0.77,0.00,7.72,0.39,0.00,0.77,0.00,15.44,4.25,3.09,0.00,5.79,1.54,2.70,3.86,3.47,0.00,0.00,0.39,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,8.49,1.54,1.93,2.32,2.70,0.00,0.00,11.20,0.39,18.15,0.77,15.83,1.54,1.16,0.39,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.39,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.39,0.00,9.65,5.02,1.93,0.77,0.00,0.00,0.77,0.39,0.00,0.00,0.77,0.00

t3_328cqj,"economic viability is important for businesses, and these plans will not provide the outcomes people want once that is taken into consideration. the trees in tree plantations are often a monoculture instead of a mixed ecosystem, so they all grow at the same rate. they may not even be from the area, as things like ""growing quickly"" will be favored over ""local type."" they are not allowed to become old growth forest with the associated ecosystem, often being cut down after only a handful of decades (which may seem like a long time, but is not for a forest). finally, the easiest land to build one is an existing forest which could be cut down to make space if it was economical to do so, which increased paper demand would do. the net effect would likely be maybe a few additional trees, but less forests. eating endangered animals, on the other hand, has totally different issues. most animals are wildly unsuited for mass production. for example, anything that is endangered because it does not breed well in captivity is a no-go. similarly many take far too long to grow to a useable size, or require more expensive food (for example, predators and meat), will fight if kept together, or are extremely dangerous. you could theoretically try to start a farm for mcbengal meat, but unless everyone is cool with paying $10,000 a burger and you can sell enough of them it is not going to be economically viable.",cq8twul,203.39839305772693,1,1428766812,23,12,1233,0,51.49221935958781,247.0,387.0,11.0,33,0.09090909090909091,0.0,0.5454545454545454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18181818181818182,0.09090909090909091,0.18181818181818182,0.0,0.09090909090909091,1.1818181818181817,0.0781060606060606,0.3076923076923077,0.0,0,0.0,250,66.85,33.00,40.79,32.64,22.73,20.80,85.20,54.40,7.60,2.40,0.00,0.00,0.80,0.00,1.60,5.20,7.60,13.20,13.60,5.20,6.00,2.80,19.20,6.00,4.40,1.20,1.60,2.40,3.60,2.00,1.60,0.00,0.40,0.00,4.40,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,17.60,1.60,2.40,2.80,5.60,1.60,6.80,1.20,0.00,0.00,1.20,2.40,0.40,0.00,0.00,2.00,5.20,0.40,0.80,2.80,0.80,0.40,1.20,13.60,2.80,14.00,3.20,7.20,4.00,3.60,0.00,0.00,2.80,0.00,0.00,0.80,0.00,0.00,0.40,0.40,0.00,15.20,4.40,6.80,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.40,1.60,0.00,1.60,0.40

t3_328cqj,"so what you are saying is that, because we preserve things with economic value, we should create uses for things without economic value so that we have a vested interest in preserving them. i see four problems with this. firstly, just because we have supply does not mean we will also have demand. if mcdonalds makes mcbengal patties, that does not mean they will sell any. the patties have to taste good, too, and if we are not already eating tigers, there is probably a reason for that. making a use for something endangered and then expecting people to come buy it just because it exists is putting the cart before the horse. (also, bengal tigers are apex predators, so we can't eat them. but that's beside the point.) secondly, there are lots of factors involved with endangerment of species. look at how much trouble we are having trying to get pandas to breed in captivity, or resurrecting galapagos turtles. it takes a lot of time, energy, and institutional will to save a species, and for all the free market's virtues, patience is not one of them. thirdly, when we 'preserve' something in this way, we change it - often fundamentally. nobody is going to mistake a ""managed timberland"" for an old-growth forest. sure, if we are getting all our wood from the timberland that means we are not cutting down forests right and left. but that timberland takes up space, and it makes perfect economic sense to put it right on top of the forest you are so keen on preserving. i mean, you are cutting down trees both ways, right? and to pick on your last example, cows are a species we created. do you see any [aurochs](running around these days? and fourthly, there already is a supply of bengal tigers. it is called poaching. tiger skins and internal organs are big business on the black market. and the wwf [addresses your suggestion directly](on their website - china has tiger farms already, and the result has only been to increase the amount of illegal poaching that goes on.

t3_3dh1ns,"the natural objection to your view is that the court can only rule on cases that are brought to them as it severely limits the absolute power they wield in terms of making final decisions on all manner of legal questions. points 1, 2, and 4 of yours however, certainly show that the court has quite a lot of formidable power to wield, but considering all of those powers can only be used in reaction to other entities exercizing their own powers first, then being sued for it, followed by multiple appeals, it is hard to view what essentially is a veto power as equal to those they are ruling over. add to that the fact that even that veto power is constrained by the majority of justices having to agree how to rule and it is even harder to consider the power they wield to be unrivaled in the country. for number 5, you never compared the likelihood of removal from the supreme court to the other branches. in neither of the other branches is it easy or common for an official to be forcibly removed from office as a president has never been removed either and only 20 of over 12,000 congressmen have ever been removed. of course they still do not have to face public reelection but since their job does not involve representing the people's will or interests as they see fit anyway, it really makes no difference. their job is to apply the laws which have already been written (supposedly) to thay effect. the meat of your case seems to be 3 though, in that they can effectively can create laws. characterizing the case you sited in support of that notion as the court creating a law looks to me like an enormous stretch though. based on what i read, it seems perhaps more accurate to say that they established congress' right to act with new powers that were not specifically granted them by the constitution, but were instead implied. taking your characterization for granted though, they still can ""create new laws"" that congress has sought to use and someone else has fought to prevent them from using. **tl;dr** all of the unique advantages the supreme court has that you list are fundamentally restricted in scope compared to the advantages the other branches have. the most basic and important power common to both of the other branches is simply the ability to use their powers when they choose to. that basic ability affords them far more flexibility than the supreme court to effect political change. if congress collectively wanted to make a law to ban all gun ownership in the us, they could, and the supreme court could not do a thing about it unless someone else objected first.",ct5dtcs,569.0903658376714,1,1437061518,51,19,33882,0,47.43781035740338,457.0,694.0,15.0,3,0.0,0.0,0.4666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.0,0.6,0.13245722531436815,0.24945295404814005,0.0,0,0.0,466,75.75,53.43,26.14,80.28,31.07,18.88,86.48,56.01,13.30,6.01,0.43,0.21,1.50,0.00,3.86,7.30,7.73,16.52,9.01,5.58,5.36,1.72,13.52,6.22,3.86,1.07,2.15,3.00,3.86,3.43,0.43,0.00,0.21,0.00,7.30,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,16.95,2.36,4.08,0.86,3.00,2.79,6.01,2.15,1.29,0.21,0.64,0.64,0.21,0.21,0.00,0.21,9.87,0.21,2.15,6.87,0.86,0.21,2.79,9.44,0.43,9.23,1.50,4.29,3.00,3.86,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.43,0.00,0.00,0.21,0.00,0.21,9.01,3.22,3.43,0.00,0.21,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.43,0.43,0.43,0.86

t3_3ev0gt,"i definitely think you have a few valid points in here - high schools should certainly teach more applicable life skills than they currently do. that said, i disagree that high school is essentially useless and inapplicable. i'm a huge supporter of liberal arts colleges, which are similar, in a way, to the high school curriculums that you are discussing - they often require ""core"" classes in the main four subjects, plus an art/music/theater class, often a religion or ethics class, and usually some social sciences. taking classes in a variety of subjects allows students to form connections between different subjects and topics within those subjects, which strengthens critical thinking skills and can be applied to real-life situations. they also allow students to develop certain skills (presenting, working in groups, organizing thoughts, solving problems, etc.) that are useful later in life. even the music and art classes that you mentioned can help students in other fields. music has been proven to be connected with language development in the brain, and both music and art are often used to discuss history and geography, which corresponds to work in other classes. both subjects also provide an outlet for students to express themselves, which (while perhaps more important in elementary/middle school than in high school) can be very important for adolescents. you mentioned that you love to write and read, and that you would like to be a novelist. you will find that most novels draw upon knowledge in a variety of subjects - you can't simply take english classes and learn to write books. based on your post, i am assuming that you are quite well-read, which means that you have probably been exposed to a wide variety of ideas, topics and cultures through reading, but not all students enjoy reading or have the resources to do that, so standardized education helps them fill in the gaps that you, perhaps, had already filled. basically, for me, it comes down to this: i see specialized programs as *training* for a specific career path, while i see more diverse programs as *education* for the future. personally, i value knowledge and learning pretty highly, so i get excited when i understand a historical reference or the math behind an interesting card trick, for instance. i know that some people do not value that as strongly as i do, but i do think that in (mandatory) schooling, students should be exposed to a variety of ideas, subjects, and perspectives. i'll keep thinking and probably reply to this post with more thoughts, because it is late and i am very tired. i like the thought and detail that you put into this question, though! i am interested in seeing what other people have to say. edit: i forgot to write my conclusion the first time...i really am quite tired.",ctip2dm,1089.0782616463207,1,1438065387,29,8,3775,0,51.53346321961624,469.0,729.0,20.0,4,0.1,0.0,0.1,0.1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05,0.05,0.05,0.05,0.0,0.2,0.0,0.7,0.06298666933341857,0.27505330490405117,0.0,0,0.0,475,56.80,59.14,65.36,84.96,25.00,25.47,90.32,51.16,14.53,8.00,4.21,0.00,2.74,0.00,1.05,6.53,5.05,12.84,8.00,5.26,7.58,0.63,15.16,6.32,4.00,1.47,0.42,3.37,5.47,4.42,1.05,0.00,0.42,0.21,7.79,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,14.32,5.05,1.26,0.84,4.00,1.26,3.37,1.89,0.63,1.26,0.00,1.68,0.21,1.05,0.00,0.21,8.42,1.05,1.47,4.84,1.05,0.21,1.47,11.16,0.63,11.58,0.42,7.16,3.58,10.32,2.53,0.00,0.00,0.21,0.00,0.21,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.21,0.00,17.26,4.42,7.37,0.42,0.00,0.00,0.21,1.05,0.42,0.63,1.26,1.47

t3_3fa3pf,"ok. i am going to look specifically at your points in turn. 1) **physical**. absolutely, men at their peak are stronger and faster than women. but a woman at her peak can be stronger or faster than the vast majority of men; look at [katrin tanja davidsdottir](i am fairly certain she could take most men on and win. to further expand on your point; so what? so women are on average less strong. i am not convinced that in the modern developed world this is a huge issue. 2) **industry**. i really think your experiences have biased you here. [oil refining is 18% female]((actually higher than i expected). this means that there will be default be a higher chance that the 'shining stars' will be male. some of the issues you have seen are down to culture; we have only recently started to accept women in formerly 'male' lines of work such as engineering, so a lot of women who could perhaps have made excellent engineers would never have thought of it as a career option. as for the women who are not good at their work- i wonder, do you notice the men who are not good at their work too? 3) **at home**. this one's awkward. there are a few different possibilities here and, i will be honest, none of my suggestions make you look good- i hope you do not get too offended. * first, i noticed that the issues you mentioned were all practical. you are an engineer- that's your bag. so you notice when your girlfriend is not good at physical things. but i wonder if you have noticed your own failings? perhaps she has always silently annoyed that you put your foot in it at social gatherings. maybe you are not very good at art or design. are these problems, are you possibly less good at them than she is? **possibly, yes**. but this is not something for which you should be blamed. they are not part of your skill-set, but you can learn. * perhaps you are impatient. when you were looking at the gear system you used your previous knowledge and applied it to the situation at hand. there is no parallel for your girlfriend; it is the same as asking someone who's only ever driven an automatic car to move to a manual. it is possible, but they will kangaroo down the road for a while before they get the hang of it. i remember that it was only a few years ago that my mum was terrible with computers. she has an intelligent woman, a teacher, but they weren't her thing. why? because she was trying to learn from me, my sister or my dad- all of whom would just say ""oh give it here"" when she was struggling. our impatience meant she didn't learn. she did a 1-week course and came out knowing everything she needed to know because the teacher there has the patience to let her learn. * maybe you date stupid or physically inept women. this is possible; i can imagine that if you show this 'women are stupid' belief in the real world, intelligent women may be less likely to want to spend time with you. -- so what does this mean? my tl;dr is that i think you are focussing on things at which you are good, measuring some women against these, then using this to judge women as a whole. we could talk about how [more women than men graduate college.](i could show you that in the [developing world women make up a growing percentage of new entrepreneurs.](but i think the most likely argument i can make is about environment. the men you hang out with are engineers. they are likely to be above average intelligence. depending on where you meet women, they are more likely to be average. a very good friend of mine is an engineer, working for one of the top companies in the world designing airports. i like to think she would be able to show you a thing or two!",ctmq4rm,770.590680590701,1,1438351555,63,10,4044,0,75.51303730394235,674.0,935.0,49.0,9,0.02040816326530612,0.0,0.14285714285714285,0.2653061224489796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04081632653061224,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.061224489795918366,0.0,0.5306122448979592,NaN,0.2062314540059347,0.0,0,0.0,687,33.80,88.08,41.12,50.20,14.62,14.41,92.87,59.24,19.07,12.52,3.49,0.44,5.24,1.89,1.46,6.55,5.68,12.23,12.08,5.82,5.39,1.89,19.80,6.99,4.37,2.18,1.16,3.20,5.09,3.20,1.89,0.58,0.87,0.15,16.30,0.44,0.58,4.51,1.16,17.18,3.78,1.60,2.18,5.39,1.31,4.80,1.89,1.16,0.29,0.15,0.87,0.29,0.58,0.00,0.00,7.28,1.46,1.89,2.62,1.75,0.29,3.20,14.56,1.31,11.64,1.75,6.84,3.35,3.35,0.15,0.15,0.15,0.15,0.00,0.58,0.00,0.00,0.44,0.15,0.00,19.07,6.11,2.62,0.00,0.87,0.87,0.15,1.16,0.29,1.60,1.31,4.08
t3_3fa3pf,"**physically.** yes, on average men are physically stronger than women. (of course, there are many women who are physically superior to many men.) but that's like saying whites are inferior to blacks because they sunburn more. you can't just pick a single attribute where there is a difference. women are [demonstrably more empathetic than men](does that make them superior, or just different? honestly, except for sports and the small subset of jobs that rely on brute physical strength, empathy is probably a more valuable attribute in both the workplace and in social situations. women also have tend to have much larger breasts than men - is that a sign of superiority? or just a sign that they are different? **workplace.** your entire argument is anecdotal - you work in a male-dominated industry (oil refining), in a male dominated department (engineering). let me counter first with my own experience - when i was managing a team of software developers, my best programmer hands down was a woman. in fact, if i stack ranked them, the guys would all be at the bottom of the list. a couple of my sons best friends are women who just graduated high school, and are going on to major in engineering and computer science. one of them is a technical whiz who pretty much ran the lights and sound for the theater and band programs and knew the sound and light boards better than any of the adults who worked there. there is enough demand for competent women in stem that they do not need to work in industries notorious for sexism, such as yours, so it is not surprising you do not see them. **at home.** i suspect that there are many things that your gf is stunned that you can't figure out. despite being pretty damn smart i suck at: * ironing * making hospital corners * anagrams * knowing what colors go together * crafty stuff my wife smokes me at all of these things - and destroys me at boggle. there are plenty of things that i am better at, but the point is that we have a range of things we are good at. we tend to put a higher value on those we are better at, and dismiss the things we suck at.

t3_34ew6y,"what you are describing is called the model minority myth. [from this thread titled: 'eli5: why have asian-americans flourished, while african-americans remain under-educated & impoverished? both were slaves here at one point, and both were heavily discriminated against throughout us history.'](>alright i will give this a shot. i am an asian american, family coming here over 30 years ago as poor refugees after a civil war. i have interned and worked at various asian american organizations in america and studied asian american studies in college. >first, you are right in that you are making a broad generalization. not all apias are in the situation you speak of. same with black americans. in fact, the broad generalization of asians being rich and smart is called the ""asian american model minority myth"". the stereotype paints a picture of smart, educated, assimilated, and rich asians in america that have ""made it"" and suggests the asian race does not need a hand out or help. it also suggests the question ""if asians can do it, why can't latinos/blacks/natives/west virginians/purple people do it too?"" this is a problem in that it is suggesting a few things. 1: asians are inherently smart and that it is tied to race. 2: overlooks the asian americans that struggle, especially groups that are refugees (vietnamese, cambodians, lao, hmong, karen, etc.) 3: suggests that other races are not up to par as this ""model minority"" group. >secondly, understand that the apia racial category in america is vastly diverse. this is an important factor. you have very rich, highly education apias, and also very poor ones that are on welfare. you have indians, chinese, koreans, tibetans, polynesians, samoans, thais, etc. >third, because of that diversity, you have different socio-economic levels within the racial category. and the reasons behind this, which you are asking, is vast. some reasons are: >* socio-economic mobility in america is tied to the family or individual's socio-economic status in the old country. for example, many military officials, government officials, politicians, etc. from the former s. vietnam fled here from their country to escape persecution. these are families that were exposed to many things that would help any family in upward mobility, namely, some english skills, standardized education (some even had p.hds from france or the us), and money. compare that to a super poor, illiterate farm family fleeing the khmer rouge in cambodia and you have two vastly different families that will develop differently in the states. >* us immigration policy has always been hard for asians. the chinese exclusion act of 188x (on my phone, forgot) was the first (and maybe only?) us law excluding a specific race from immigrating to the us. so for the longest time, until about the 1960s, asian immigration was capped. this is somewhat important in that this is why the apia population is small (3.4% of the population). >* some asian americans have been here for a very, very long time and have been able to acquire more and more in each generation. the japanese are an example of this. they mainly came over 100 years ago. as generations are born in the states, they assimilate and take on more opportunities. during wwii, japanese american men comprised of several military units that fought valiantly in europe. they then came back, went to school, and became successful. daniel inouye is a good example of this. there are dozens of japanese american politicians who are 3-4th generation. they are success lies in the fact that their families have been established in america for generations. vice versa may apply. if your family is poor, there a chance your kids will be poor, and being poor may continue for generations. >* as another posted suggested, rich asians come here and succeed in numbers that rival asian americans. my university had a huge ass korean and chinese international student population. they made up 50% or so of the ""asian"" student population. these guys were filthy fuckin rich. i saw one drive around in a mercedes suv that had diplomatic plates. often, americans can't tell them from asian americans and assume

t3_2ux0lc,"the principle of reddit is to permit each subreddit to have a maximum amount of freedom to develop in whatever bizarre direction it chooses. while the admins have bent this principle in response to media pressure, they generally respect it and the more consistently they respect it, the better. so, for example, there are subs like /r/stormfront which logically you might think would be sub about the hate-group, but instead it is a weather-related sub, purely because the owner of the sub thinks its funny. examples of these sorts of ironic and quirky uses of subs abound. in other cases subs create all sorts of unusual strictures to create a specific kind of interaction. cmv, for example, could theoretically be structured in all sorts of other ways, but to generate the specific kinds of discussions that the mods think are useful, they demand justifications, op engagement, forbid playing devil's advocate, forbid emotional appeals, forbid top-level agreement, and so on. askhistory demands that anyone (who is not part of the clique running the site) who answers a question provide citations and supporting quotations on-demand within 24 hours. books wants all requests for book recommendations in a weekly thread on that subject. science wants to be in effect a meta-journal, without any posts that are not links to peer-reviewed articles. many porn subreddits ban gay porn. none of these choices are obvious or necessary. you could design a sub for one topic in many ways, which which lead to communities that appeal to different groups of people. the fact that the mods of creepypms like their coffee with sugar does not mean that you can't have yours black; but reddit provides resources for you each to make your own subreddit, not for you to assert control over theirs. the specific tactic of refusing to let commenters criticize, question, or antagonize posters is used on many subs. there are dozens of subs for the purpose of posting obviously fictional stories (like creepy), where it is forbidden to question the reliability, honesty, consistency, or thoroughness of the op. the goal is partly to prevent people from interfering with enjoyment of the stories (which, if dissected, are as useless as an over-explained joke) and partly to give people as many incentives to post new content as possible. whether this rule is good or not for any particular sub is debatable, but at bottom a matter of taste; and in the end if your tastes differ from the mods' tastes, your recourse is to make your own sub.",cocgji2,108.4476358367827,1,1423174827,13,8,1256,0,47.66509431325977,421.0,667.0,17.0,23,0.0,0.0,0.29411764705882354,0.29411764705882354,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058823529411764705,0.11764705882352941,0.0,0.0,0.058823529411764705,0.0,0.823529411764706,0.0592670177045177,0.32304038004750596,0.0,0,0.0,429,91.37,68.77,15.53,51.97,25.24,23.78,83.22,48.02,9.79,3.50,0.00,0.00,2.33,0.00,1.17,6.29,6.99,17.25,6.29,1.86,5.83,1.86,11.42,4.90,3.03,2.10,0.70,4.43,6.53,3.96,2.56,0.23,0.70,0.23,10.02,0.00,0.23,0.00,0.00,19.35,3.73,3.50,1.86,5.13,2.56,5.59,1.17,0.23,0.00,0.00,1.86,0.00,0.00,0.70,1.17,7.93,1.17,1.86,4.90,0.70,0.23,0.47,9.56,0.70,7.46,0.47,5.59,1.17,1.86,1.86,0.00,0.00,0.23,0.00,1.17,0.00,1.17,0.00,0.00,0.00,15.15,3.96,6.53,0.00,0.47,0.00,0.00,1.63,0.00,0.70,1.40,0.47

t3_33fvr1,"i think there is a bias involved here, but not the one that you think. we have pretty much agreed as a society that the correct standard to use in criminal cases is ""beyond a reasonable doubt"". we do this because without it, no one could ever be convicted of anything, because there is always doubt, even if it might be unreasonable. it is a tradeoff between the safety of many innocent people vs. the safety of a very small number of innocent people. the definition of ""reasonable doubt"" is usually phrased as: >""reasonable doubt is not mere possible doubt. ""it is that state of the case which, after the entire comparison and consideration of all the evidence leaves the minds of the jurors in that condition that they canot say they feel an abiding conviction to a moral certainty of the truth of the charge."" i think that you are right that death-penalty opponents have a lower chance of convicting someone of a capital charge. however, i think that's because they would use a standard of evidence higher than ""beyond a reasonable doubt"". because of the worry that the criminal might be put to death, they would require certainty beyond *any* doubt, which is not a standard that we can possibly use and still protect society against murderers. the question is not who has a higher or lower standard of saying someone is guilty. it is ""who will properly use the standard of guilt that we, as a society, have decided is appropriate"". anyone that has a strong moral reason not to use that standard of guilt is not appropriate for a trial. some kind of sadist who is all gung ho to kill people would be likely to use *less* than a standard of ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" in a capital trial, and they should be excluded. someone who is morally opposed to killing anyone for any reason would be likely to use *more* than a standard of ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" and *also* should be excluded. both should be excluded. either that, or we should just change the standard to ""beyond all doubt"" and never convict anyone. or even better, in my opinion, get rid of the death penalty, because it really does require a moral certainty that's far beyond ""reasonable doubt"". but as long as we have the death penalty, and that uniform standard of guilt, we can't allow anyone on the jury that will be biased to use any different standard of guilt for any identifiable reason.",cql32pv,502.53574546466905,1,1429731324,138,15,50276,0,60.39842479421304,422.0,618.0,19.0,126,0.10526315789473684,0.0,0.21052631578947367,0.631578947368421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.1410493827160494,0.1848341232227488,0.0,0,0.0,422,67.92,54.71,24.32,3.36,23.44,20.38,88.63,57.58,13.27,4.27,0.95,1.66,0.47,0.00,1.18,9.00,9.95,13.98,11.61,4.98,5.69,2.37,15.88,5.92,4.50,1.42,0.47,3.55,8.06,2.84,5.21,4.03,0.71,0.47,8.29,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,27.96,5.21,5.92,2.37,9.48,2.84,5.92,0.71,0.00,0.47,0.24,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,7.82,1.66,0.24,2.37,0.47,3.32,0.24,12.56,0.95,7.11,0.71,4.98,1.42,0.71,0.00,0.00,0.24,0.71,1.66,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,16.35,4.50,4.03,0.24,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.24,4.50,0.71,0.00,2.13

t3_33f4nn,"i agree that homosexuality should be legalized, but your reasoning seems faulty to me. > as long as an action does not cause harm to anyone else (including society as a whole) or infringe upon someone else's rights, then it is not immoral. i found this [here](""standing by itself, the rule ""an action is morally acceptable if and only if it does not harm anybody"" sounds good and certainly makes a great bumper sticker, in reality it simply does not work at all and makes no sense. for starters, this rule is far too restrictive. according to it, it would be wrong to apply for a job for which there are several applicants, since your getting this job harms the person who was the second choice. similarly, a company inventing a product that makes some other company's product obsolete harms the employees and shareholders of that other company since they can no longer profit from their product. yes, i would say that taking away somebody's livelihood constitutes ""harming"" him by any reasonable definition of this word. the proponent of the ethos ""an action is morally acceptable if and only if it does not harm anybody"" therefore quickly has to add all kinds of qualifications and exceptions until his whole framework essentially collapses into naive utilitarianism. second, the rule is absolutely meaningless without an objective and operational definition of ""harm"". for example, many muslims currently seem to be very hurt by the famous danish cartoons. similarly, many christians feel very hurt about gay marriage, another thing that famously never seems to harm anybody. of course i can't see into their brain to measure if these people are really ""hurt"" or just pretending to be, but based on their externally observable behaviour, i tend to believe them. at this point, the proponent of this ethos can do no better than spin ad hoc explanations why somebody ""really is not harmed"" even though he sincerely feels that he is, or to explain that when you hurt only feelings, it is not really ""harming"" at all. (very well, let us see if you still think this way if i start mocking rape and cancer victims.) or as seems to be common with these particular examples, argue that harming some people actually is not that bad since they do not really count. for example, pat robertson's feelings and anguish seldom seem to be much concern to anybody. perhaps the rule could be modified so that it says ""an action is morally acceptable if and only if it does not cause anybody having justified feelings of harm"". but this is just a sleight of hand that tries to sweep the problems under the word ""justified"". hiding these problems does not make them go away, since people can't agree at all when somebody's feelings of being harmed by somebody else's very existence are justified. we can see this vividly in, for example, the anguish of mom-and-pop stores when wal-mart comes to town. (by the way, i think it is quite funny how the vocal proponents of gay marriage and the vocal opponents of wal-mart tend to be the exact same people, who totally reverse their logic of what constitutes ""harming others"" when they switch between these two tasks.) third, all our actions have a vast array of direct and indirect consequences that we are not able to track or perceive. the butterfly flapping its wings causing a hurricane and so on. anything that we do is certainly somehow bound to harm other people. this ethos simply turns ignorance into virtue: as long as you are suitably unaware of the consequences of your actions, you can do anything you want!""",cqkapdq,187.50590613006605,1,1429667851,171,13,1120,0,49.79763076923078,611.0,955.0,25.0,3,0.08,0.04,0.28,0.24,0.04,0.0,0.04,0.04,0.0,0.12,0.08,0.0,0.04,0.0,1.0,0.04614494301994302,0.25040916530278234,0.0,0,0.0,616,43.68,47.40,44.24,3.10,24.64,21.92,89.45,56.17,15.58,5.52,1.30,0.81,1.30,0.65,1.46,10.06,5.19,12.99,8.12,6.49,7.63,3.08,13.96,3.57,2.11,1.62,0.65,2.60,7.63,2.60,5.03,0.00,0.49,0.65,9.09,0.49,0.00,0.16,0.65,22.40,5.52,4.06,2.60,6.33,1.79,7.47,3.57,0.65,0.65,1.79,1.62,0.32,0.49,0.65,0.16,5.68,1.14,0.65,1.46,1.14,1.46,0.65,12.66,0.16,9.09,2.11,4.22,2.76,2.76,0.16,0.16,0.49,0.49,0.00,0.81,0.00,0.00,0.65,0.16,0.00,15.91,3.90,4.55,0.16,0.00,0.00,0.16,0.65,3.57,1.30,1.14,0.49

t3_3juxpc,"you are correct in that sales tax is regressive. you are also correct in the sense that it acts as a disincentive to purchase locally as opposed to online sellers who do not charge sales taxes for whatever reason. you are not correct that it disincentivises all purchasing, for the simple fact that purchasing certain goods such as food, water, clothing and shelter are more or less necessities (especially in an urban environment where most shelter is privately owned and actively utilised, and there is insufficient food and water naturally occurring to hunt/scavenge/forage). sales taxes also have the advantage of potentially being **very simple** to implement, collect and oversee - they are the classic republican-style flat tax. sales tax can be designed to be more progressive. the most common way this is done is by carving out exemptions to certain categories of items. fresh food and medicine are typical examples. these exemptions allow the poor, who spend a greater proportion of their income on these necessities, to avoid paying the sales tax. one problem with this is defining the exemptions. in australia, prior to the repeal of state-level sales taxes in favour of a national sales tax (gst), a candidate for a major party went to an election promising to bring in a national gst. however, in a famous interview, the candidate could not adequately explain if a cake would or would not attract gst. his party lost, and the gst was not introduced until almost a decade later. a second alternative is to create 'luxury' taxes. australia has a luxury car tax, for example. the challenge here is that the definition of 'luxury' is subjective, and open to lobbying for exemptions. it is also not possible to create a value threshold for a higher rate of tax - ""all purchases over $5000 attract luxury sales tax"" would not work, because transactions would be structured to avoid triggering the threshold. moreover, overseeing such a regulation would most likely prove more expensive than the revenue it would bring in, making the whole exercise pointless. therefore in most circumstances sales tax is a regressive tax, and initiatives to reduce regressiveness **drastically increase complexity**. however, property tax is not necessarily that much better. the first thing to keep in mind is that all businesses use some quantity of real estate in their dealings. as such, the cost of a property tax will act as a universal cost of doing business which businesses will attempt to pass on to the consumer in the form of higher prices. the degree to which this cost is passed on is known as the **incidence** of the tax, and depends on the elasticity of demand. the elasticity of demand is the degree to which consumers choose to consume more or less of a good or service depending on the price. an elastic good is one for which a given change in price brings about a larger change in consumption, while an inelastic good is one for which a given change in price brings about a smaller change in consumption. since we already established that consuming goods such as basic food, water and shelter are more or less essential, they are **very inelastic** as an overall category. it may be possible to substitute goods for cheaper goods to some extent, going from name brand to home brand, from fresh milk to powdered milk, from steak to mince, but this can only go so far. at some point, even the poorest need to eat x calories a day containing certain nutrients to avoid starvation or malnutrition respectively. therefore, the incidence of a property tax will fall disproportionately on the poor, at least as far as basic consumption is concerned. an interesting effect of raising property taxes is that it **reduces the value of property**. this occurs because the cost of property taxes can be modelled as an annuity being paid to the government. if we assume a 4% interest rate, the value of this annuity is x/0.04, where x is the annual cost. if a property initially worth $500,000 goes from no property tax to a 1% property tax, the value of the property should fall by $125,000 to $375,000. this occurs because the property goes from $500,000 property + no annuity to $375,000 property + $125,000 opportunity cost (where the $125,000 is the cost to 'buy an annuity' to offset the property tax). note that there is an interesting spiral here, where if the property got reassessed at $375,000, the new smaller property tax would need a smaller annuity to offset it, and the price should go up. it gets complicated quickly... but the key point is that raising property taxes reduces property prices, overall. there is also something called the **wealth effect**, in which households who feel more wealthy due to increasing asset prices start to spend more. this is partly credited with the acceleration in economic activity that occurs in response to a reserve bank reducing its main interest rate. it is also partly credited with the deceleration in economic activity that occurs if a reserve bank jacks up its interest rate. guess what? raising a property tax does the same thing - it will cause homeowners to feel poorer, and therefore to spend less. this is compounded by the fact that property taxes tend to arrive in the mail quarterly or annually, resulting in *big bill shock*, while sales taxes just chip away at your spending power subtly. property taxes do have advantages, especially those based on assessing unimproved land value rather than market value, but that is outside the scope of this discussion. plus, i think everyone's passed out by now. **tldr:** sales tax is regressive, but simple. simple is good. making it less regressive makes it much less simple, which is a bad tradeoff. property taxes can hurt the poor as bad as sales taxes. they also make the middle class feel poorer, so they spend less. it is too simplistic to assert that property taxes are better than sales taxes. ps: suggested future reading -

t3_37m5jw,"i think when examining the dangers that the mid 20th to early 21st century presented, it is fair to say that some of the american wars, particularly in korea, vietnam, and afghanistan were justified and fought to preserve the sovereignty and freedom of the united states population. from the standpoint of the korean and vietnam conflicts, i view them in the context of the larger cold war. regardless of what is said today, the soviets were a very real threat. an ambitious empire that could not coexist with a capitalistic superpower, they represented the possibility that communism (in practicality, despotism) could domino-effect its way into the american sphere of influence, the western hemisphere, and eventually the united states (and if you doubt the existence of the domino effect, look to the arab spring). the wars in vietnam and korea served to stem the domino effect, and prevent marxism from leaking over into japan and south korea. afghanistan meanwhile, was a response to 9/11. but keep in mind what 9/11 was. it was an attack that represented a threat to a nation as a whole. imagine if the terrorists had attacked the capitol. the federal government would be crippled. terrorism did represent an existential threat to the united states, and therefore america was obligated to attack the state that was directly aiding and abetting such a threat.",crofn5p,91.03202197771644,1,1432873117,46,8,36603,0,44.15876623376627,224.0,376.0,11.0,1,0.0,0.09090909090909091,0.09090909090909091,0.36363636363636365,0.0,0.09090909090909091,0.0,0.09090909090909091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.18181818181818182,0.0,0.9090909090909092,0.015458937198067632,0.3482142857142857,0.0,0,0.0,229,95.35,51.75,8.24,1.00,20.82,24.89,72.93,50.22,6.99,2.18,0.87,0.00,0.44,0.00,0.87,4.80,14.85,12.23,6.55,3.06,6.99,0.44,9.17,2.62,0.87,1.31,1.75,0.87,7.42,0.87,6.55,3.06,4.80,0.00,3.06,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,10.04,3.06,3.06,2.62,2.18,0.87,1.75,2.18,0.87,0.87,0.44,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,9.61,0.44,0.44,7.86,0.00,3.06,4.80,3.49,0.44,9.61,0.00,6.55,3.06,0.87,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.31,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,13.97,4.80,6.11,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.44,0.00,0.00,1.75,0.87

[**wrong!**](the first past the post system makes it more likely they will only get 1-5 seats in parliament. so why is everyone worried? well, a more likely consequence of support for ukip is that major parties will drift to the right to try and win back the ukip vote. **did you know that they are global warming denialists?** read [this page](from the ukip daily, if you do not believe me. frankly, this is not up for debate. climate change *is* happening, humans *are* causing it and humans *must* do something about it. the evidence is overwhelming and for a political party to be sticking their head in the sand like this is backwards, embarrassing and downright dangerous. **the eu is not a monolithic dictatorship imposing its petty whims on beleaguered britain.** **disclaimer:** the eu is *complicated* guys. i am going to oversimplify for the sake of getting my point across. i could write a thesis on the organisational structure of the eu and, while i think there is plenty to criticise, we *do* get a say in eu laws and regulations. the eu does not have a hold on us any more than westminster has a hold on the people of yorkshire. we devolve certain things for the eu because it is advantageous for the entirety of europe to agree on a common baseline for things like food quality, environmental regulations and management of common resources like fisheries. we can still pass our own laws on these things, as long as we meet eu regulations as a minimum. *i'm looking at you,* [denmark!](there are also advantages, beyond questions about regulations. as an eu citizen, i have the right to live and work in any other eu country and receive the same level of state health care as a citizen of that country. now, i was an expatriate in eu for about a year and it is looking like i am going to be one again very soon. for me personally, an eu exit would be a disaster. for all this scaremongering about immigration, we have to remember that freedom of movement goes both ways. ukip will * legalise discrimination against gay people, like indiana [1](* scrap the inheritance tax, dealing a heavy blow to redistribution of wealth in the uk [2]((you did say you were a leftie, after all.) * scrap sex education in primary schools [2](* repeal the ban on smoking in pubs, strangely enough. i quite like going for a drink without reeking to high heaven afterwards, your opinion may vary [2](so, in summary, ukip are bad news. however, i have to admit that i am with them on hospital parking fees. ~~edit: well, it looks like op has hit and and run. that's a shame.~~ edit2: hey folks, do not downvote ukip supporters just because you disagree with them. downvotes do not change views.",cqtp0m2,839.8493397712293,1,1430393076,110,11,-19845,0,63.61015425531916,800.0,1191.0,47.0,3,0.10638297872340426,0.0,0.0851063829787234,0.23404255319148937,0.0,0.0,0.02127659574468085,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06382978723404255,0.0425531914893617,0.553191489361702,0.011024844720496894,0.285,0.0,0,0.0,814,69.74,70.15,35.65,41.31,20.87,18.92,85.75,55.04,12.65,7.62,2.83,0.98,2.58,0.00,1.23,5.04,7.86,14.74,10.57,5.16,5.53,1.97,17.08,4.55,3.07,0.49,1.97,2.21,5.28,3.07,2.21,0.61,0.49,0.12,9.71,0.25,0.12,0.12,0.12,10.93,2.33,1.47,1.35,2.58,1.23,3.07,2.09,0.74,0.61,0.49,1.23,0.12,0.49,0.25,0.37,8.23,2.09,1.35,3.56,1.35,0.98,2.21,12.90,1.72,11.92,2.09,7.13,2.46,3.69,0.49,0.25,0.61,0.49,0.00,0.86,0.12,0.12,0.25,0.25,0.00,22.48,5.16,4.55,0.37,0.00,0.37,0.25,0.37,0.00,0.74,1.35,9.34

t3_361cys,"so, i just put the finishing touches on a paper related to this topic -- the neuro-physchological responses of leaders and followers. there are several issues here, but they all relate to two critical qualities required for all leaders: trust of those they lead; and, an appreciation of the emotional context of the people under them. for people in political positions there are two groups for whom they act as leaders. the first is their constituency, the people who elected them. the second is their staff. the trust and support of both is necessary for their success. if they are also chairs of particular committees there may be additional groups as well related to the uniqueness of their particular position. for years, the model in america was to assume that emotion has no role in managerial decisions, and thus no real role in leadership. but we now know that this simply is not true. all decision making is driven by emotional biases, and research into the neurobiology of leadership shows that employee innovation and engagement improves significantly when leaders promote positive emotional responses in those who follow them -- which starts with the leaders own actions (zhou, cheng & xia, 2014). but what is really interesting is that people who follow leaders respond physiologically differently to leaders who are seen as deserving of being followed (boyatzis et al., 2012). the research shows that when a leader is trusted, what they say is actually processed differently in the brain than when a leader is not trusted. leaders who lose trust of those who follow them literally can not be heard the same way again because the emotional centers of the brain direct the brain to actually process incoming messages from those leaders differently. molenberghs et al. (2015) showed that semantic processing for leaders who are seen as trusted actually activate mirror neurons in followers who thus feel a strong connection and desire to follow that person, specifically in the areas of hte bilateral pars opercularis, bilateral rostral inferior parietal lobule and the posterior midcingulate cortex. this processing does not happen when leaders are not seen as worthy of the follower. in other words, a leader's effectiveness is dependent upon the selective neural processing of those they lead. you can't fake that by pretending you didn't lose trust. social identification with a leader by the followers is essential to leader success. a leader who has broken social trust by being involved in scandal is in a very difficult position. the short version of all of this is that while leaders can recover from scandal, it requires that at least one of the two groups they need for success (the staff or the constituency) see the scandal not as the leader breaking social trust with them, but as the leader being attacked from outside the ""in group"" that the leader represents. if that is the case, then the leader has some chance of recovery. of the two groups, it is actually the staff, not the constituents, who matter most for political leaders in most cases (unless they are currently engaged in an active campaign effort), because constituents have a short memory, but immediate success or failure is dependent upon the staff. what is problematic is that self-inflicted scandal like this tends to be extremely disheartening to the staff. several studies have linked self-inflicted scandal with significant reduction in staff performance. if a political leader has figured out that he has lost support of his staff, his constituency, and to some extent his party, it very well may simply not be worth it to try to fight it out. once you have changed the way people think about you, it is physiologically impossible for things to go backwards. you can't disassociate that memory and the resulting loss of trust, and thus you can't change the automatic low-level neural processing that determines how people literally are able to hear what you say. now, the following is speculation, not science, but: one of the reasons i think clinton survived is that the gop turned the lewinsky thing into a gop versus democrat affair. this enabled the white house staff to see the entire thing as an external threat and attack. had the gop not gone after clinton in such a partisan fashion, and instead focused on something like ""the public shame of him abusing his position of power to take advantage of his staff,"" he likely would have had a much worse time of it. boyatzis, r. e., passarelli, a. m., koenig, k., lowe, m., mathew, b., stoller, j. k., & phillips, m.

t3_3irh3k,"while perhaps in a world where everyone made decisions based on pure rational thinking, this might be true, i do not think this would be an issue in the real world, for two main reasons (both of which are based in current popular perceptions): 1. as /u/madplato mentioned, employers are often already biased against hiring women because of the perception that they will probably get pregnant at some point and take off from work. i do not think requiring employers to pay for the maternity leave would much affect this perception, because i doubt employers will seriously think women who otherwise wouldn't have gotten pregnant and taken time off anyway will now decide to do so just for a few months' pay. this negative perception of women already unfairly affects women who do not intend to have children. 2. employers often already have a perception that men will be more dedicated workers, whether or not you have paid maternity leave, or paid leave for both parents; there is an expectation that men will take less time off for any family-related reason than women. so i think even if a law requiring paid maternity leave did harm women, adding paid paternity leave wouldn't fix that, because the underlying assumptions about men and women wouldn't change. finally, i would say that even taking into account a small chance that employers will discriminate against women more if required to pay for maternity leave, it would still do more good than harm to women workers on the whole. not being able to take any time off work to recover from pregnancy and spend quality time with your baby can be a huge source of pressure for women, and can force women to put off having children until later than they would want. all of these factors harm women.",cuj0bdo,604.845154088868,1,1440795881,31,9,2170,0,49.282000000000025,302.0,453.0,10.0,2,0.2,0.1,0.1,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.2,1.2,0.1595799262465929,0.2251655629139073,0.0,0,0.0,307,58.23,65.22,63.87,9.67,30.70,21.50,95.77,51.47,8.47,3.26,1.63,0.00,0.98,0.00,0.65,5.21,4.23,14.01,11.73,6.51,6.19,2.93,21.82,4.56,2.93,1.63,0.98,4.56,3.26,0.98,2.28,0.65,0.00,0.00,12.70,3.58,0.00,5.21,1.30,22.48,5.54,4.89,3.91,4.89,1.30,5.21,1.95,0.00,0.33,0.00,2.61,0.00,2.61,0.98,0.00,9.45,0.65,1.95,4.23,2.93,0.33,3.58,13.03,2.61,14.66,2.61,6.51,5.54,5.54,0.33,0.33,2.93,0.00,0.00,0.98,0.00,0.65,0.00,0.00,0.33,10.10,3.26,3.91,0.00,0.33,0.00,0.00,0.33,0.00,1.30,0.33,0.65
t3_37xfke,"i think one way to look at the concept of cultural appropriation is to examine it in terms of power dynamics. one of the key aspects of oppression is the denial of voice to those being oppressed. let us take iggy azalea as an example. hip-hop and rap have, historically, been strongly associated with african-americans (disclaimer: i do not know very much about iggy azalea, hip-hop, or rap, but hopefully even if i am wrong about the specifics the argument still works in the abstract). it is been a way for many african americans to communicate their specific and unique cultural viewpoint, when often other forms of artistic expression have crowded them out. when iggy azalea comes along and starts employing the same devices in the same styles, she becomes a key figuire in the way we look at hip-hop and rap, and black voices are further crowded out from one of the relatively few forms of expression in which they have had a foothold. i feel pretty comfortable saying this is a bad thing. but is iggy azalea personally to blame for this, or does the responsibility extend further? to me that's the larger and more complicated question. segregation is bad, i absolutely agree, but that does not mean integration is inherently good. if that integration happens in a way that completely subjugates the culture of one group for the benefit of another, i would say that's generally an undesirable state of affairs.",crqq0yt,160.2471270577252,1,1433097561,137,6,19826,0,45.285208643815196,244.0,401.0,11.0,1,0.0,0.0,0.36363636363636365,0.09090909090909091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09090909090909091,0.09090909090909091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6363636363636365,0.05352564102564102,0.28688524590163933,0.0,0,0.0,248,77.16,56.41,34.13,25.77,22.55,22.98,84.27,53.23,10.89,5.24,2.82,0.81,0.00,0.40,1.21,5.65,8.47,14.52,9.68,5.24,6.45,0.81,14.92,6.05,3.23,1.21,1.61,2.42,5.65,2.82,2.82,0.00,0.81,0.00,8.47,0.00,0.00,0.40,0.00,11.29,3.23,0.00,2.02,3.63,1.61,4.03,4.44,1.21,2.82,0.40,2.02,1.21,0.00,0.00,0.81,6.45,1.61,0.40,1.61,1.21,1.61,1.21,12.10,0.40,10.89,1.61,6.85,2.42,1.21,2.02,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.81,0.00,0.00,0.81,0.00,0.00,12.90,4.03,4.84,0.40,0.00,0.40,0.00,1.61,0.00,0.81,0.81,0.00

""meaning"" the concept as opposed to ""meaning"" the feeling, as far as i can see, has no need to be attached or correlated to some arbitrary concept like ""time."" you know when you are sorta youtube surfing and you start on some silly video and later end up on a 2 hour documentary on some huge scientific conquest we have done in the last decade sometimes? or sometimes, it is the opposite, but often, you will watch a video about puppies playing patty cake with cats and then suddenly **here's all the physics ever.** (edit: so re-reading this, i realized that at this part, i accidentally did it in the same order twice so it is not the opposite at all but i am sure reddit will forgive me just like they forgave that one guy who misspelled his name) one of those videos i watched, i think, was about what is outside our observable universe. it started out with stuff outside of what we can see because of expansion, and that was like ""meh"" because it was mostly, as far as we can tell, just our stuff, same composition, pretty uniform except for some cold spot that could be evidence of a multiverse or something. and then they started talking about the multiverse. and how there are totally different temporal dimensions that our temporal dimension exists in and how our ""forward"" in time is ""up"" one level up or some crazy arbitrary dimension. like, you just sorta realize that time is **totally and completely arbitrary.** people put so much emphasis on time being such a huge thing, like if we do not last until the end of the universe in 10^gazillion millennia or whatever they calculated it to be, we do not matter, but no, it is just another arbitrary dimension, it is like saying that unless i am really, really fat, i do not matter and i am totally meaningless because i do not take up as much space in this dimension. ###so... ___ being dependent on time is so, so arbitrary. time is just a randomass mechanic that our minds just sorta found it convenient to interpret. i mean, everything about our universe is just interpretations. these colors are just radiation. there is radiation going directly into my eyes right now and some physical law has allowed a mysterious thing called consciousness to emerge from the soup inside my head to make what we call an image out of that. time is like color, we are just looking at entropy and somehow, the evidence of less entropic states enters each of our consicous states in order to make memories. my take on this is if there is a meaning out there, you wouldn't know. meaning, as far as i can define it, is ability to have some sort of effect. i am not sure if logic even exists outside of our universe, like i do not know if true and false are just suddenly not the only states of things outside here, but as far as i can tell, the best definition is having an effect, and when you have rigorous laws and logic, everything you do affects everything. the universe is just a structure, time included, just like a bunch of blocks you put together to make a jenga tower that relies on every piece to stay up except jenga is literally the opposite of that, but everyone always uses it as a metaphor for engineering so w/e. that's what chaos theory is, if you change anything or remove anyone, suddenly the universe does not exist. it is gone. if someone from outside the universe came in and made you not exist, literally the entire universe is gone. aliens outside of our observable universe but still in our universe would just, without even knowing why, also stop existing because they rely on your existence. that's fucking crazy, like, right now, some pregnant alien overlord is worried about their leadership and their baby and they are not worried about me at all, but if it weren't for me right fucking now being a thing, they would be freaking dead. they do not even know. i'm not even sure i am trying to change your mind at this point, i started typing and then i just got really enthusiastic, but yeah, you really should realize that ###tl;dr (honestly, do not read the above, it is a ramble because i fucked up and i am too lazy to fix it) ""not lasting forever means we are meaningless"" is so super duper arbitrary when you realize how non-unique and special time is. it is just, like, another thing. like a burger. it is like saying if i do not always have everything to do with this burger, i am meaningless, from cow to slaughter to consumption. why a burger? why not a sandwich? or a late night television show? at the very least, if we are meaningless, it is not because we will not last forever.",cuad8r8,317.60026701659535,1,1440138170,49,11,8878,0,58.08601284745863,913.0,1335.0,37.0,11,0.02702702702702703,0.02702702702702703,0.2702702702702703,0.43243243243243246,0.0,0.0,0.13513513513513514,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.13513513513513514,0.0,1.027027027027027,0.05902639027639028,0.1829134720700986,0.0,0,0.0,917,24.64,47.82,86.40,33.29,26.20,19.52,91.82,62.05,16.79,8.72,3.38,2.51,1.74,0.11,0.98,8.07,5.02,13.30,10.91,8.51,9.49,2.73,16.79,4.36,3.82,1.64,0.65,2.94,2.84,1.64,1.20,0.22,0.44,0.00,8.18,0.22,0.11,0.00,0.22,21.16,4.47,2.84,1.64,6.11,2.73,6.43,2.07,1.53,0.22,0.33,1.64,0.33,0.44,0.44,0.76,6.11,2.62,0.87,2.29,0.55,0.11,2.18,12.43,0.76,15.05,1.42,8.07,5.67,0.87,0.87,0.11,0.00,0.00,0.22,0.87,0.44,0.33,0.11,0.00,0.00,16.68,3.82,7.09,0.11,0.11,0.44,0.00,0.22,1.74,0.76,0.44,1.96

t3_3jui0a,"eu countries, such as germany or austria, for example, have a problem: they have a comprehensive and general pension and health care system but they run of out of people who pay into that system (young people who work) and gain more and more people who take out of the system (old and retired people) due to the low birth rates. hence, there are three options: (1) goodbye welfare state that the vast majority of people there support and benefit from (2) have a lot of kids in the next years to come so the lopsidedness of the age-distribution decreases and the system becomes more sustainable again. (3) allow young people from other places to come in and contribute in the economy to ""save"" the social welfare system. point (1) is highly unpopular and point (2) just will not happen. hence, even though immigration is not popular either, it is the only realistic way to save the welfare state without making major cuts or enacting huge tax increases (which would probably not work too well either since the tax rates are already pretty high there). so there is a strong economic incentive for western european countries to accept immigrants/refugees, especially young ones. on top of that, these countries have had muslims immigrating for quite a while now (there are 3rd+ generation immigrants from muslim countries already), and the vast majority of them are integrated. so when they became and still become citizens it was not a huge issue at all since their mindsets are not that different to that of austrians after all. they want to have a decent life, and they will vote in their interests. in my entire life have i not met a muslim in austria (where i am from) who was anti-democratic, pro-sharia law, or terribly sexist. they do exist, but they are such a small number and thus under the perception threshold. hence, they are a huge potential gain for the economy and not a threat to our secular society. this is why it is good for the host country.",cusjrg4,118.04444815876457,1,1441559240,122,14,17075,0,54.632963800905,340.0,505.0,13.0,2,0.07692307692307693,0.3076923076923077,0.38461538461538464,0.9230769230769231,0.0,0.07692307692307693,0.15384615384615385,0.15384615384615385,0.0,0.07692307692307693,0.0,0.0,0.15384615384615385,0.07692307692307693,2.384615384615385,0.05405773420479304,0.2852941176470588,0.0,0,0.0,349,64.80,51.15,62.57,78.31,26.85,18.62,85.10,53.87,8.88,4.30,0.86,0.29,0.00,0.00,3.15,4.58,7.74,12.61,8.31,8.60,7.45,2.29,12.61,5.73,2.58,2.29,1.72,3.15,5.16,4.01,1.15,0.29,0.29,0.29,8.31,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,13.47,1.72,2.87,0.86,2.58,1.15,5.16,0.29,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.86,0.00,0.86,0.00,0.00,7.45,0.86,2.01,3.72,1.43,0.57,2.01,10.32,0.86,16.05,1.15,9.17,5.73,4.01,0.00,0.00,2.01,0.86,0.00,0.29,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.29,0.00,16.05,3.72,4.01,0.57,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.86,0.57,0.00,5.73,0.57

t3_3fc3o6,"i think you already know you are rationally incorrect, but you are trying to justify an instinctive preference for the naming system that ""feels"" right in your gut. the single-last-name-of-father system likely feels most correct to you because it (a) is most familiar and (b) gives you the most benefits while asking the fewest concessions. first, you know that you have an ingrained and biased preference about names: you prefer your wife and children take your name, but would feel uncomfortable or disappointed by the opposite. this is not a topic on which you are neutral and simply trying to find the easiest universal system. as a measure of clarity ? who is related to whom ? hyphenating provides *more* information. the single-last-name system obscures familial relationships in comparison. as a measure of legal identity ? how many people share your name ? hyphenating makes each name more distinct. i too work in an industry where i deal with thousands of names and families. the single last name system does not allow me to know ?who is related to who? at anything better than an educated guess. i know dozens of families who share last names but no close relation. i know dozens of blended families. i know dozens of guardians who don?t share names with children, and committed couples who are not married. i also know siblings who get mistaken for spouses, and spouses who have been mistaken for siblings. helping strangers make assumptions based on a single last name seems like the weakest possible defense. as a matter of personal identity ? the right of a couple to determine family identity and choose names that are appropriate, representative, and meaningful ? having a range of possibilities means couples can make a decision about how they understand their family construction. group labeling and identity are incredibly strong sociological forces. as a measure of ease ? spelling, length ? that consideration does not exist in any other naming context, and it becomes absurd to try to impose the ease standard universally. if your wife had a much shorter last name than you, would it be inconsiderate to give your own name to your children? is it unnecessarily complicated to give children a first name with more than one syllable? is it unacceptable to name your child after your french mother if the name may be difficult for american businesses? maybe more to he point, though, the difference in ease between the most complex and most simple names i have *ever* written has been minor - a dozen letters, a double-check on spelling, a confirmation. literally a difference of a few seconds. while this drifts from your true argument, these lines of thinking quickly move into the larger name-choice debate, which in my experience usually boils down to ?people who name their kids something i like or understand are exercising reasonable freedom of choice. people who name their kids something i dislike or don?t understand are selfish and stupid.? you have not said this, but i think it is worth pointing out that are cultural biases about names are deep-seated. i do see nods to individual choice in your post, but only if you never have to interact with a world where people choose differently than you. women should not have to take their husband?s name, but you only want to marry a woman who will. men should have the option to take their wife?s name, but you will never consider it. children can have either parent's name, as long as yours have *only* their father's. gay couples need ways to build family identity, but only if you do not have to see a hyphenated name. you want people to have choices about identity labels - - - as long as every choice is based on what you find easiest and most comfortable. if a stranger's choice is not based on your preference, they are selfish and inconsiderate. when a family you do not know fills out a birth certificate, you ask that the first priority be guessing your experience if you meet their child at work in twenty years, and the second priority be articulating their identity as a family in a way that feels personally appropriate. also, as a side-note, it is a pretty well-documented phenomenon that people are less likely to change a position after taking a public stance. you begin by saying you have ?had a lot of fun at the expense of people with two last names.? if you have expressed ?joking? superiority or derision towards people who do not like the same names you like, then you may feel compelled to justify that you were just smarter all along, rather than arbitrarily judgmental or dickish. edit: formatting",ctnx69r,2999.661119710036,1,1438443304,40,18,63761,0,52.41179487179488,780.0,1221.0,36.0,1,0.05555555555555555,0.0,0.25,0.16666666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027777777777777776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08333333333333333,0.0,0.5833333333333334,0.05822201607915893,0.2423076923076923,0.0,0,0.0,794,67.92,95.05,41.91,49.19,21.46,20.91,88.79,49.75,13.48,8.31,1.76,0.00,5.16,0.13,1.26,5.16,6.80,12.47,7.81,3.40,7.05,1.51,15.11,7.68,5.29,2.64,2.14,3.53,4.79,2.90,1.64,0.13,0.25,0.13,20.15,2.77,0.00,0.76,0.63,19.40,6.68,2.14,2.64,5.29,1.13,5.42,1.39,0.25,0.25,0.63,0.76,0.13,0.25,0.13,0.13,7.81,3.40,1.13,2.02,0.88,0.50,1.01,12.85,0.63,8.69,0.50,4.91,3.27,1.26,1.51,1.01,0.38,0.00,0.00,0.38,0.13,0.13,0.00,0.13,0.00,12.22,4.16,3.65,0.25,0.00,0.38,0.00,1.89,0.25,0.38,0.50,0.76

t3_3hwmik,"really, you are looking at this from a very weird angle. there is no way that the statement ""college is better"" could be true unless we assume particular goals. sure, college is better for *particular individuals*; the same goes for apprenticeships, trade schools, the military and going straight to work. each of these routes may be better for *particular* students with *particular* goals. for example, if your goal is to be a chemist, then college is better. on the other hand, if your goal is to be an electrician, then apprenticeships are better. if you have other goals, then other options may in fact be better. ""better"" makes no sense without assuming some sort of goal that's to be attained. after looking through some of your posts, it seems that you are not saying that ""college is better"", but rather that ""college is better *if you do not know what you want to do*"". that's a better claim, and is something that could be discussed intelligently. again, this depends on particular individuals. not everyone has the time or money to waste on a few semesters of college taking general courses because they do not know what they want to do. if you do not know what you want to do, then those other routes have advantages over college in that they will actually provide you with money and work skills until you discover your calling. after this pondering, then you can accomplish your goals *without* unnecessary debt imposed by college attendance. also, you can even attend college after this pondering process; this has an advantage over going straight to college because all four years will be spent pursuing the goal you want, rather than wasting 1-2 years and money on miscellaneous courses (which may potentially block you from certain majors that require all four years to complete curriculum). furthermore, just as not everyone can do the military, it is also true that not everyone has the aptitude or interest to attend college.",cub9bjx,1120.604641452022,1,1440203839,24,8,3255,0,57.27585819486407,331.0,503.0,16.0,15,0.25,0.0,0.25,0.125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0625,0.0,0.0,0.3125,0.0,1.0,0.09637566137566139,0.1903323262839879,0.0,0,0.0,333,34.38,64.09,29.21,96.01,20.81,22.52,93.99,57.66,15.92,6.61,0.00,0.30,5.41,0.00,0.90,9.31,4.20,12.91,13.51,3.30,7.21,3.30,18.02,8.41,6.31,1.20,1.20,1.80,5.41,5.11,0.30,0.00,0.00,0.00,9.31,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,20.42,3.30,1.20,3.90,6.01,3.30,8.11,1.50,0.60,0.30,0.30,0.30,0.30,0.00,0.00,0.00,10.51,0.30,7.81,2.10,6.31,0.00,0.30,16.52,3.90,10.21,1.50,4.20,4.50,10.21,0.00,0.00,1.80,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,18.02,4.80,5.71,0.00,0.60,0.00,0.00,0.30,2.40,0.60,0.60,3.00

t3_36gs5s,"well there is nothing wrong with the act of eating meat itself. what is typically thought to be wrong about meat-eating is the suffering inflicted upon animals as part of industrial farming. if we were to reform our practices around meat-eating, however, and do away with these objectionable conditions, it is possible to to satisfy your first condition, to hold that eating meat is permissible. for the second, we just need to hold, quite reasonably, that animals have rights against being harmed and that non-consensual sex is a harm. both of these are pretty straightforward given how we view the torture of animals and rape. i suppose what puzzles you is the apparent tension between saying ""it's ok to kill an animal and eat it"" and ""but animals have rights against being harmed."" this tension can be resolved if death turns out not to be a harm for the one who dies. now this is actually a fairly tenable view. consider some paradigmatic cases of harm: you break your leg, you are robbed, or you are psychologically abused. something every case of harm seems to have in common is that the harm involves a comparison your state of being before and after the harming event. so when you break your leg you are worse off than you were before breaking your leg in virtue of the pain and hindered motion that you experience. if you are robbed you are worse off than you were before the robbing in virtue of being deprived of whatever was stolen. if you are psychologically abused, then you are worse off in virtue of the change in your mental well-being. so harm involves a comparison between how you were before the harming event and how you were after it. given this comment element it is reasonable to define harm in comperative terms. so something like ""s is harmed by event x if and only if s is made worse off than they were with x having happened."" now when we try to conceive of death as a harm we run into a problem. namely, there is no ""you after death"" to compare to. so before death you were x, y, and z, but after death you are non-existent. since there is nothing to compare to, we can't count death as a harm on the comparative account that i gave above. perhaps there is some other way to make sense of death as a harm for the one who has died or perhaps death is only bad for people who cared about the deceased and have had their own interests frustrated by her death. i am not going to come down on either side of this debate here, but the latter is at least a reasonable approach to take and if it is correct then we can coherently say of animals that it is ok to kill them, but not ok to harm them. does that make sense?",crdxea2,410.6304977953835,1,1432062108,81,15,13186,0,66.30453340402971,492.0,691.0,23.0,1,0.08695652173913043,0.0,0.21739130434782608,0.4782608695652174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.08695652173913043,0.0,0.9565217391304348,0.1253968253968254,0.18699186991869918,0.0,0,0.0,497,56.22,81.20,23.68,1.00,21.61,15.29,90.74,60.97,14.29,8.05,0.60,1.61,4.83,0.20,0.80,6.24,5.43,17.71,11.47,6.04,8.25,1.41,17.71,6.44,5.63,2.21,0.80,1.41,9.86,2.62,7.24,0.40,1.41,0.40,9.66,0.00,0.00,0.20,0.00,13.48,2.21,2.21,1.81,4.83,1.21,5.23,1.61,0.40,0.40,0.20,3.02,0.60,0.20,0.40,1.81,5.23,1.61,0.80,0.60,0.40,1.81,3.82,13.08,0.60,10.66,1.41,4.63,4.02,0.80,0.00,0.00,0.20,0.00,2.82,1.01,0.00,0.00,0.60,0.40,0.00,11.27,4.43,3.42,0.20,0.00,0.20,0.00,1.01,1.61,0.40,0.00,0.00

t3_3f20yi,"first of all, let me just say that i understand how you feel. i have been in the same situation as you but not for the same reason. i'm from the us and during my middle school through early high school years, i went to school abroad in a non-english-speaking country. ignorant remarks about my mastery of the english language were commonplace, with my peers often telling me to not speak english because i was not in the us, speak clearer, speak slower, and to go back to the us if i was going to speak english. sometimes they would be joking, other times i feel not so much. violence would not have solved anything. it is not like once i would've hit them they would have gone ""wow, i guess this guy's right. he has changed my view entirely with a punch to my face"". no. they would have resented me, associated violence with being able to speak english correctly, and strengthened their opinion as true. the fact is, ignorant people react this way to things that seem foreign to them because that's what they have been taught. their negligent parents never taught them to be tolerant or that people can be with whomever they want. or those types of reactions are applauded by their ignorant circle of friends. or, in your case, they grasp at the opportunity to make sure their friends do not think they are gay too (though most of the time the people that make the most commotion out of it are usually the ones that are hiding something). ultimately, violence does not deter this kind of behavior. in the short run, yes: you can raise hell and they will go away. but the next day they will find someone that can't defend his or herself physically against these bullies and the ignorance continues. the only thing in the world that solves ignorance is education. not violence. and we are getting there. think of it this way: homosexuality has been seen as bad for hundreds (if not thousands) of years, and the western world has undergone the transition from ""gays = weird, disease-ridden, etc."" (ignorant, inaccurate descriptions) to just having legalized gay marriage a couple of weeks ago in the us. as with most issues of ignorance in society, it takes a while to eradicate it. blacks and whites getting along as they do now (for the most part) was inconceivable to americans of just 100 years ago. look how far we are now. the good news is that we are getting there.",ctkoehq,418.95223209613766,1,1438203514,42,15,7268,0,72.63841820151681,426.0,592.0,26.0,1,0.038461538461538464,0.0,0.07692307692307693,0.23076923076923078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07692307692307693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15384615384615385,0.0,0.5769230769230769,0.016825396825396827,0.2511737089201878,0.0,0,0.0,429,43.34,58.30,56.04,10.90,16.50,18.65,91.38,58.97,17.72,11.19,3.96,1.63,0.93,0.70,3.96,6.53,6.06,13.52,10.72,4.43,6.53,3.03,19.11,5.13,3.26,0.93,1.17,2.10,4.90,1.86,3.03,0.00,0.47,0.00,11.89,0.47,0.70,0.23,0.70,15.85,2.56,2.80,1.86,4.66,1.63,5.13,3.50,0.93,1.86,0.70,1.63,0.23,0.47,0.93,0.00,8.16,2.56,1.40,2.56,1.40,0.70,3.96,13.05,0.70,12.82,2.33,5.36,5.59,1.86,0.23,0.00,0.00,0.23,0.00,0.47,0.23,0.00,0.23,0.00,0.00,16.08,6.06,4.66,0.47,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.70,0.93,1.17,1.86,0.23

t3_3aimk2,"i had an existential crisis of sorts a couple of years ago, so all of these thoughts are very familiar. the idea of us all being essentially mechanical is a thought trap. it is logically appealing due to its backing in science and empiricism and all that... the problem with it is that it does a poor job of describing us humans. formally speaking, a piece of music is a combination of sine waves of varying amplitude and phases. a painting is a bunch of pigments that reflect different wavelengths of light. a book is a series of symbols, and not very inventive and diverse at that. a flower produces chemical substances that excite nerves in our olfactory system. food combines nutrients with flavours and a bunch of other things. none of these descriptions are wrong... and that's the insidious thing about them. life is not about being technically right. in fact, technically right is the dullest kind of right. do not get me wrong, there is nothing at all wrong with seeing things as they truly are. in fact, being able to see things as they truly are is an extremely valuable skill. but the idea that reality is devoid of meaning and, to borrow a word from you, sparks... that's something you have added on top, for no good reason. that's the wrong part. that's the idea you have to doubt, to be sceptical about. people do not enjoy paintings and music and books and the experience of a sunset because of a bunch of mathematical equations. people enjoy these things because of what they mean. do you know how insanely improbable it is for us to be able to look at a sunset, and breathe, and have trees framing the view, in the first place? the probability of that possibility having come to pass is so close to zero you can't even imagine a number that small. the world can be explained in terms of formulae and scientific models, but that never needs to take away the absolute miracle that it all is. and nobody really has an explanation of how the world could come to be the way it is now. some people turn to religion to explain the world and the things in it. personally i have given up on trying to explain it. i think miracles do not *need* an explanation, even though of course explanations can be useful and enlightening. in light of all that, the fact that we can ""explain"" our subjective experience in terms of an electrochemical apparatus that does things... that's just the tiniest detail. in fact we are really quite bad at explaining how our experience arises out of electrochemical processes. we kind of understand the interaction on the cellular level, and we have identified a bunch of areas in a bunch of tissue that seem to be doing something, stuff like that. the rest is still essentially intractable to us... but that does not stop people from going around proclaiming ""all you are is a bunch of chemicals"". yeah, like that is a good explanation... that's just a fragment of an explanation, really. perhaps some day someone is going to discover, with tools that we have not invented yet, that our electrochemical apparatus, if replicated atom by atom, does not work, that something is missing. and then that day we might realize that the world is not as entirely physical as we thought. or maybe we will be able to make perfect copies of humans. in the present, however, we do not know. it is just thought experiments. we can argue about it until we are blue in the face but we still will not know. here is a hint to keep in mind when reading research: ""we found no evidence"" does not mean the thing they looked for does not exist. it just means that the methodology used by the study was not suited for finding evidence *or* maybe the thing does not exist. we can't really tell the difference. (taking this point further is a different topic, see /r/philosophyofscience.) that medication can have side effects does not really answer the question one way or another. the environment we find ourselves in can influence our mood quite a bit, too. for instance, i do not like walking through heavy traffic nearly as much as through, say, a forest. so you might say my mood is caused by traffic -- it is not that different from saying my mood is caused by a bunch of chemical changes, a drug perhaps. perhaps the traffic caused me to take drugs? at some point these attempts at causal explanations become ridiculously rickety. (and, by the way, it is perfectly possible to feel good despite traffic... i would go as far as saying it is probably possible to feel good despite the drug, but of course i can't prove that and i certainly do not have a convenient step-by-step guide.) there's a good chance that the stuff you have taken has influenced you... but, the way i see it, it does not directly ""cause"" your mood and thinking and all that, and certainly taking it away is not going to directly ""cause"" you to go back to normal. part of that is on you... you do that part by understanding that the way you were thinking about this that got you to write your post is not formally incorrect, but also just a tiny part of the real story that you have been forgetting to pay attention to for a while. keep that in the back of your mind and you will be getting back into the whole story again in no time at all, and it will be almost impossible for you to ever forget it again.",csd7mip,1809.4839296372404,1,1434838118,63,16,20266,0,69.51435057521738,965.0,1377.0,59.0,2,0.05084745762711865,0.0,0.1864406779661017,0.13559322033898305,0.01694915254237288,0.0,0.0,0.01694915254237288,0.0,0.01694915254237288,0.0,0.03389830508474576,0.05084745762711865,0.0,0.5084745762711865,0.03995621237000547,0.21450777202072538,0.0,0,0.0,965,53.21,60.63,54.37,34.78,16.36,17.62,90.16,60.83,15.23,6.42,1.24,2.59,2.07,0.00,0.52,8.81,8.08,14.40,11.09,6.11,6.22,3.21,17.62,3.32,1.76,0.52,0.31,3.42,3.42,1.76,1.24,0.10,0.31,0.10,7.56,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,18.65,5.39,1.97,0.73,3.63,2.90,5.08,2.49,1.04,0.73,0.31,1.04,0.31,0.62,0.00,0.10,6.94,2.69,0.93,0.83,1.76,0.93,1.35,14.20,1.04,10.67,1.35,6.74,2.80,1.55,0.41,0.00,0.31,0.10,0.00,0.21,0.00,0.10,0.10,0.00,0.00,15.85,7.77,4.25,0.10,0.00,0.21,0.00,0.41,1.04,1.04,0.41,0.62

t3_30a5zk,"so i think we can address by dividing this into three different categories, all of which are wholly non-binary. note that this is not a comprehensive look at how things work, but i think it adequately addresses your confusion here. 1) physicality - this is your sex. whether you are born with a penis or a vagina or both. note that the existence of the ""both"" means that this is not a binary thing. more or less, our society uses sex to determine gender. 2) identity - this is your gender. gender and sex are two very different things. for instance, i am a man and i have a penis. if, for some reason, i were to lose my penis in an accident of some kind, that would not stop me from being a man. i would still feel like a man in my mind, even though i am missing the instrument which our society (largely focused on binaries) says is necessary to be a man. *your gender identity exists in your mind.* it is not determined by what exists between your legs. i also know some people who do not feel like a man or a woman, and prefer to be referred to by gender-neutral pronouns. 3) expression - so we have talked about our physicality, our identity, and now we are going to talk about our behaviour. remember, gendered behaviour is entirely socially constructed. in our hegemony, however, it is believed that behaviour is determined by gender, which is determined by sex. for example: ""people with penises are men, and therefore act masculine."" so where i think you get mixed up is that you think the trans* experience boils down to number one and number three. you are conflating gender identity with gender expression. somebody who is born with a vagina but identifies as a man does not necessarily subscribe to hegemonic standards of masculinity (that being the idea you mentioned, conflating ""manhood"" with 'masculine' things like sports). you do not *have* to like sports to identify as a man. to use myself as an example again, i am a man and i do not particularly love sports. that does not affect my actual identity, or how i *feel* i am. so maybe i lose my genitalia, and i still do not behave in a very ""masculine way."" i still think of myself as a man! the three are not interdependent, and that is the basis of the trans* experience. a trans* person is simply an individual for whom number one - their sex - and number two - their gender identity - do no correlate the way we might like. for the record, as a cis man my understanding of the trans* experience is limited. i understand your confusion and i appreciate that you are trying to better understand the experience as a whole, or else you wouldn't be on cmv. hopefully this helps.",cpqjney,705.8027273127326,1,1427315114,66,9,-23029,0,62.80954960438223,477.0,724.0,31.0,3,0.06451612903225806,0.03225806451612903,0.1935483870967742,0.22580645161290322,0.0,0.03225806451612903,0.0,0.06451612903225806,0.0,0.0967741935483871,0.0,0.03225806451612903,0.0,0.0,0.7419354838709676,0.0921969696969697,0.18658280922431866,0.0,0,0.0,482,40.52,66.85,56.57,53.05,16.07,18.05,86.72,58.71,17.43,11.00,5.39,2.07,3.11,0.00,0.41,6.43,7.26,12.03,9.96,5.60,7.47,2.70,16.18,3.11,3.11,2.28,2.07,2.07,2.70,2.07,0.62,0.00,0.00,0.62,12.66,0.00,0.00,0.21,2.90,16.80,6.02,1.66,1.24,3.53,1.24,5.39,1.87,0.21,0.21,0.62,3.94,1.66,0.41,2.49,0.41,5.60,2.70,2.07,0.41,0.41,0.62,1.24,13.69,0.62,6.43,0.83,3.73,1.87,0.21,1.04,0.21,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,19.09,6.22,4.77,0.21,0.00,0.00,0.21,1.87,1.66,0.62,1.45,2.07

t3_36k79b,">i think the idea is that the consumer will only purchase from corporations that are good. actually, the capitalist principle is the full protection of an individual's right to private property, the implementation of which means theft, or the initiation of force/coercion, is completely outlawed. as a result of individual freedom to say ""no"" to another without fear of their body or property being infringed upon, or beaten up or thrown in jail, the only remaining option by which people may profit from others is by voluntary and non-coerced trade. when voluntary trade is the only option, corporations are required to ""play nice"" - or at least appear to. this means the behaviour that is ultimately encouraged and rewarded by society/the market is *producing something of real value*. no longer can they use guns to get what they want - they have to be productive to survive. and if what they produce is valueless or of lesser value, the market will eventually find out and say no. the idea is that ""bad corporations can not survive for long"" in an environment where *not only* individuals are free to choose their own best option of value for money *but also* companies are banned from using force or theft. in a semi-capitalist system (mixed economy) like ours, bad companies *can* survive - any special monopoly granted by the government to one corporation is a *theft* of the rights of another company to compete in that same market. such laws and regulations give an *unjust* and artificial advantage to a company by effectively giving them the backing of (governmental) force to make a profit. so capitalism working well is not just about the consumer's choices - whether he buys the cheapest or whether he buys the most virtuous. market forces are only one side of the economic equation. politically and socially, capitalism also requires a social system where potential *producers* are free from force *to produce*. ultimately it is not just the consumer who brings down bad corporations - it is the existence and healthy proliferation of *good competing corporations*. and they exist best when the playing field (the law and the government) is fairest - protecting individual property rights equally and giving special advantage to no one.",creq49t,177.2732865629053,1,1432113288,39,5,3995,0,39.03185365853662,369.0,623.0,15.0,66,0.13333333333333333,0.06666666666666667,0.06666666666666667,0.13333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.4666666666666667,0.05017551892551892,0.2791327913279133,0.0,0,0.0,373,79.73,51.07,10.29,98.90,24.87,26.01,89.28,52.28,7.77,3.22,0.27,0.27,0.00,0.54,2.14,4.56,8.85,13.94,7.77,5.90,7.77,2.41,12.06,5.09,2.95,2.95,0.80,1.88,8.58,7.24,1.34,0.27,0.27,0.00,7.77,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.54,14.48,2.41,4.29,0.54,4.83,0.27,5.09,0.80,0.27,0.54,0.00,0.27,0.27,0.00,0.00,0.00,11.80,1.07,3.75,5.63,2.68,1.34,0.27,10.19,1.34,6.70,0.80,4.83,1.07,10.72,0.54,0.00,5.63,0.00,0.00,0.27,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.27,0.00,18.23,4.02,2.68,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,2.14,1.61,0.54,1.61,5.63

t3_39tm84,"i think there are two separate issues here. first is whether people have a right to appropriate art. second is whether there is a legitimate basis for offense from those whose art is appropriated. i think the answer to the first is obviously that yes, you have a right to appropriate art. do what you want, wear what you want, and, as with anything, be aware that others will have reactions to what you do that you cannot control. if you are fine with that, go ahead - you are a free person. anytime somebody tells you not to do something because it constitutes appropriation, you should assume that what they mean is ""i will be upset with you if you do this thing"" rather than ""you are not free to choose to do this thing"". that is a separate question from whether those who feel their culture has been wrongfully appropriated have a legitimate grievance. i think of appropriation as divorcing the artistic value of something from the cultural context in which it was created. an analogy that i like to use to illustrate this is is the commercialization of christmas - i am sure there are many observant christians who believe that christmas traditions are intended to spring from a place of faith and reflection, and a belief that christ is their savior. they probably see non-christians (or non-observant christians) as ""appropriating"" christmas, in some regard, by tying it so closely to consumerism. of course it is everybody's right to celebrate christmas as they please, but i wouldn't begrudge a christian for feeling like everyone else has ""ruined"" christmas by taking it so far away from its spiritual roots. christians who strongly and genuinely object to the commercialization of christmas are clearly a minority in the u.s., and therefore their perception of the meaning of christmas is out-voted by the relatively-less-godly majority, and they lose control of society's dominant interpretation and valuation of the holiday. other forms of cultural appropriation similarly divorce the entertainment value of certain art forms from the social context and life experiences that created it in the first place. as a result, society sees that art and values it very differently from the intent of its creators, and depending on what those differences look like, it can be a perfectly understandable grievance that you as a potential appropriator are free to choose to concede to or ignore.",cs6dg04,108.8174987642644,1,1434336218,78,9,4122,0,49.34730526624617,401.0,633.0,17.0,4,0.058823529411764705,0.11764705882352941,0.17647058823529413,0.5882352941176471,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058823529411764705,0.058823529411764705,0.058823529411764705,0.0,1.1176470588235294,0.0829656862745098,0.23940149625935161,0.0,0,0.0,406,57.83,70.62,26.55,67.66,27.07,24.88,91.87,59.11,18.47,6.65,1.72,0.00,3.20,0.00,1.72,11.82,6.90,15.02,10.59,2.96,6.65,0.99,16.01,4.93,2.96,3.20,1.23,0.99,6.16,4.19,1.97,0.25,0.49,0.99,9.85,0.49,0.00,0.00,0.00,17.98,4.93,3.45,1.72,3.69,1.72,4.93,1.72,0.74,0.00,0.49,0.49,0.25,0.25,0.00,0.00,4.19,0.74,2.71,0.99,0.49,0.25,1.23,13.55,0.99,7.39,0.25,3.94,3.20,0.99,1.97,0.00,0.99,3.94,0.49,0.25,0.00,0.00,0.25,0.00,0.00,13.05,4.19,3.94,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.72,1.97,0.74,0.49,0.00

t3_3cpk6q,"so while i agree with you that overall, the arguments in favor of legalizing prostitution are better than the ones against it, maybe i can at least offer a couple of points. 1) legalizing prostitution might have a negative affect on poor women (or men, let us keep this gender neutral). with such a readily available income source, people who are struggling to pay the bills might become prostitutes instead of pursuing their actual goals. similarly to how children in developing countries could be ""forced"" into child labor if it is legal, people can be economically ""forced"" into prostitution. i believe people should have a right to their own body etc, but when economics are involved, it becomes a little fuzzy. for example, we do not allow people to sell body organs, because those who are desperate for money would feel compelled to. 2) prostitution is far harder to regulate than you seem to think, and it is tough to protect men or women who are putting themselves in a vulnerable situation where they are alone with a ""customer"". sexual assault and other forms of violence are not uncommon in these situations.",csxrzz6,104.79647657308513,1,1436475184,373,34,2065,0,49.59506578947372,190.0,299.0,8.0,2,0.25,0.0,0.375,0.125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.125,0.125,0.0,0.125,0.0,1.125,0.12756132756132757,0.3,0.0,0,0.0,192,62.22,71.66,23.51,2.59,24.00,21.35,91.15,54.17,11.98,5.73,1.56,1.04,1.04,0.00,2.08,6.25,5.21,14.58,13.02,3.65,5.73,1.56,15.62,5.73,3.12,3.12,1.04,1.04,6.25,1.56,4.17,1.56,1.04,0.52,12.50,0.00,0.00,1.04,1.04,17.19,3.12,4.17,2.08,4.69,0.00,5.73,1.56,0.00,0.00,1.56,4.17,1.04,0.00,3.12,0.00,7.81,1.04,1.04,5.21,1.04,0.52,0.00,13.02,1.04,8.33,0.52,6.77,1.04,6.25,0.00,0.00,4.69,0.00,0.00,0.52,0.00,0.00,0.52,0.00,0.00,14.58,4.17,5.21,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,3.12,0.00,2.08,0.00
t3_3cpk6q,"i used to feel the same way op does. it seemed like a completely victimless crime the government has outlawed on moral standards. however, the more i learned about prostitution, the more i learned the ugly truth. most prostitutes (especially young prostitutes who are the highest in demand) are not doing so 100% voluntarily. they have either been coerced by their boyfriend or outright trafficked for the purpose. prostitution and sexual slavery are so intertwined that it is impossible to separate the two. pimps do not provide protection for working girls (as is the common perception). in fact, they will typically trade the health of their girls for money if the price is right. however, they emotionally manipulate (through constant violence) the behavior of the girls that work for them. it's a dirty, ugly, violent profession. the rates of sexual assault are incredibly high. you might be thinking ""but those things could all go away with regulation"". well, in a perfect world that may be the case. but police only have so much manpower. and what do you do when you know a young girl is being mistreated but defends her pimp? police face these obstacles all the time. i do not agree with america's current take on prostitution. personally i like the approach certain scandinavian countries are trying wherein prostitution is legal but soliciting is illegal. this still gives police a foothold to get in a legal position to protect the victims. the point is, the *theory* of prostitution is fine, but the *reality* involves a lot of victims who are being used and exploited for their youthful bodies for the financial gain of other people.",csy8wb0,147.27609014634214,1,1436505226,373,34,32107,0,59.184521739130446,276.0,436.0,20.0,3,0.0,0.0,0.4,0.05,0.0,0.05,0.0,0.05,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.55,0.04381466486729644,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0,0.0,277,68.59,52.89,35.51,15.59,13.85,25.27,90.97,53.07,10.83,5.78,1.81,0.00,1.08,0.36,2.53,5.05,10.47,10.83,11.91,5.05,6.14,1.08,17.69,6.50,2.89,1.44,0.72,2.89,5.78,2.53,3.25,0.00,1.44,0.00,7.94,0.00,0.36,1.81,0.36,15.52,2.53,1.44,1.08,3.61,2.89,5.42,0.72,0.00,0.00,0.36,4.33,0.72,0.36,3.25,0.00,9.75,0.36,1.81,5.05,1.81,1.08,2.17,13.00,1.08,10.47,1.08,6.14,2.89,5.05,0.00,0.00,1.44,0.36,0.00,1.08,0.00,0.36,0.36,0.36,0.00,15.88,6.86,3.25,0.00,0.00,0.36,0.00,0.00,0.72,0.72,2.17,1.81

t3_30oi71,"first, your disagreements about different funding ideas are not attacks on the basic income itself, unless you were attacking resource taxes used to fund resource dividends, a different but related idea to the basic income, but you did not address that. you want to keep the progressive income tax? fine by me. second, there is no evidence that the government can run people's lives better than they can run their own. the government can cause people to make better decisions by educating them and providing resources. but when the government imposes regulations, demands paperwork, and takes enforcement action against people, the burden and stress discourages personal improvement. and experiments with direct cash transfers to the poor show they often come up with useful and responsible things to do with the money that the experts never thought of. finally, the sanction of taking away money is counter productive. becoming homeless almost never causes addicts to give up drugs, teenagers to study more, or the overweight to buy more nutritious foods. third, your support of means testing contradicts your paternalistic desire for conditional transfers to protect poor people from their own irrational behavior, unless you believe the rich are less inclined to irrational behavior. why only tell the poor what to do with their money? part of the issue here is that many ubi supporters see a ubi not as charity, but as justice. the ubi is compensation for obeying a system of laws imposed by others that includes a set of property rights i never agreed to which denies me access to most of the earth. the poor deserve the ubi. you do not tell bill gates what to do with his money, do not tell the poor what to do with theirs. fourth, if technology reduces the need for workers, why use the threat of starvation to force people to do jobs they do not want to do and which society does not need anyone to do just because you want these people to experience the dignity of work? you pointed out elsewhere that welfare does make people lazy; people want to be productive. lottery winners and rich heirs do not stop working. instead they find work to do that fulfills them personally. if it becomes possible for automation to give literally everyone the same opportunity, why deny them that? fifth, a basic income is a keynesian stabilizer. a basic income funded primarily from an income tax would become a massive institutionalized entitlement expected by the population whose cost would automatically increase and decrease in direct opposition to the economy. as unemployment rises, the number of net receivers goes up, and as unemployment falls, so will the number of net receivers. keynes once famously said that the government should pay people to dig holes and fill them back up again. but why waste people's time? anyone who sits on the couch and watches tv while living off of a basic income will contribute as much to society as the hole diggers. and anyone who does anything more productive will create a net good for society. sixth, the welfare trap does not mean that recipients become lazy bums. it means that recipients remain poor and in a cycle of being working poor and receiving benefits regardless of how hard they work. complying with the paperwork and conditions for receiving tanf is so burdensome i once had a client take a semester off from college so she catch up on her welfare-to-work paperwork and conditions. once welfare recipients start working, if they report it, they lose benefits quickly and remain poor, and if they do not report it they are committing fraud and risk jail. a recipient who saves or invests a windfall can be kicked off of benefits for having assets even if they have no ongoing income, forcing them to spend down until they again have nothing left and forcing them to spend several months with no assets or income while they reapply for benefits. advocates for the poor receive training in how to advise their clients to spend down windfalls without running afowl of many complicated rules essentially advising their poor clients in how to remain poor. seventh, i agree we should not even begin to consider eliminating the minimum wage and labor laws until there is a basic income sufficient to realistically allow workers to walk away from employment they do not like, which would be well north of $12,000 per year, probably more in the $15,000 to $20,000 range. finally, opposition to conditional and means-tested benefits does not imply opposition to all government spending other than a ubi. the ubi can be paid to citizens in-kind. cash is presumptively best, but that presumption can be overcome by evidence showing that certain goods are best provided by the government. single-payer health insurance has mt that burden, as have parks and libraries. also, the government can invest in the wealth of society at large, such as with spending on universal education, infrastructure, and scientific research.",cpudthh,7550.489940600839,1,1427628876,74,25,-12298,0,50.68937451903841,833.0,1324.0,39.0,1,0.10256410256410256,0.0,0.20512820512820512,0.15384615384615385,0.0,0.0,0.05128205128205128,0.02564102564102564,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05128205128205128,0.05128205128205128,0.6410256410256412,0.059936043488675074,0.2665066026410564,0.0,0,0.0,843,79.40,63.46,15.65,31.85,21.62,23.61,88.85,50.18,9.73,5.22,0.59,0.12,1.19,0.36,2.97,4.51,6.88,15.18,7.47,4.27,7.24,2.37,13.88,6.05,2.73,2.14,2.02,1.54,6.88,3.56,3.20,0.59,0.47,0.24,9.49,0.00,0.00,0.24,0.12,13.29,2.49,2.73,2.25,2.02,0.95,4.39,0.83,0.47,0.12,0.12,0.83,0.00,0.71,0.00,0.24,11.15,0.12,2.73,7.24,2.14,0.59,1.30,11.51,0.47,10.08,2.49,4.74,3.80,9.73,0.24,0.36,6.64,0.00,0.00,0.24,0.00,0.00,0.12,0.12,0.00,10.68,4.03,4.74,0.00,0.12,0.59,0.00,0.59,0.00,0.24,0.00,0.36
t3_30oi71,"> section v: does the welfare trap truly exist? > moreover, libertarian supporters of ubi/nit bring up the ""welfare-trap"" that exists in means tested welfare programs. i did a pretty lengthy search and could find no actual numerical data to confirm that this effect is significant. there are too many conflicting motivations at play, too many demographics, too many differing situations to say for certain our current welfare system turns people into lazy bums who will not seek work. most welfare recipients today, given the opportunity, would prefer a steady cash income and the opportunity to advance to a stagnant and unproductive life on welfare. they want to look for work. try searching for 'welfare trap', 'welfare cliff', 'unemployment trap', 'welfare marginal withdrawal rates', 'participation tax rate' ... or, to save some time, search google images for 'welfare cliff' or suchlike. i am very surprised you have seen no evidence of them. i do not know what effect you would think is ""significant"". there is left and right consensus they exist. note: as they apply to individuals and households (some benefits, e.g. uk's housing benefit, are allocated to 'households' not individuals in the household), it is important to look at the effects on households too. i know next to nothing about the myriad systems in the usa. cato has claimed there are 126 federal schemes and then of course there are systems in a particular state. but if any system withdraws a benefit as you earn additional units of currency there is a disincentive. such disincentives are inherent in means tested tax-and-benefits systems as the benefits are withdrawn (at different rates) in combination with income taxes (including national insurance contributions and suchlike) as you earn. *marginal withdrawal rate* if for example a dollar is withdrawn for each additional dollar earned from work, that is a 'marginal withdrawal rate' of 100% and he wouldn't be better off working those additional hours. *participation tax rate* ptr measures the percentage of earnings lost in tax or withdrawn benefits when an individual moves into work. if a person faced a ptr of 100% then he wouldn't be financially better off working than not working as what he earned would be withdrawn from his benefits. of course not all rates are 100%. but the higher the rate the higher the disincentive. and it is even possible to have rates greater than 100% - in other words it costs you more to work than sit at home. and that's without considering transport to and from work and any other costs of working. *varying hours of work* and there is another consideration: how the system copes with varying hours of work. in the uk we have a growing number of people on so-called 'zero hour contracts' - no guarantee of working hours. one week it could be zero, another week 20, another week 10, another week 30 hours or whatever. how does the system cope with that? suppose the system underpays one week or month, leaving you short of money or overpays and claws back the difference. that makes it difficult to plan ahead.",cpufpbf,5208.954474199177,1,1427637741,74,25,-3433,0,54.87235023041475,504.0,807.0,31.0,1,0.03225806451612903,0.0,0.0967741935483871,0.45161290322580644,0.0,0.0,0.03225806451612903,0.03225806451612903,0.0,0.03225806451612903,0.03225806451612903,0.06451612903225806,0.0967741935483871,0.0,0.8709677419354837,0.11711951447245565,0.25595238095238093,0.0,0,0.0,518,79.67,45.39,21.26,86.16,17.86,24.52,81.08,46.33,8.30,3.86,0.77,0.39,1.16,0.77,0.77,4.44,5.98,14.09,7.34,3.86,7.14,2.32,13.71,5.02,3.47,1.35,2.32,3.28,4.63,4.05,0.58,0.00,0.00,0.19,5.21,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.77,12.74,2.70,1.35,2.32,3.86,0.97,4.83,1.54,1.35,0.19,0.00,0.77,0.00,0.77,0.00,0.00,8.88,0.39,5.60,1.16,3.28,0.39,1.93,11.00,0.97,11.00,1.35,5.79,4.05,9.27,0.19,1.16,3.67,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,20.46,5.98,3.67,0.58,0.00,0.39,0.00,1.16,0.77,4.25,1.16,2.51

t3_34az47,">so the federal reserve is in charge of printing money right? they print more, and then the government feeds it to the big banks **and is dispersed (kinda) outward.** that last bit is actually not as direct as you imagine it. there is an economic force in any system that has borrowing and lending called the [money multiplier.](essentially, the amount of money (defined as what is in everyone's bank accounts) is a function mostly of supply and demand for loanable funds. if people want to borrow and lend a lot, the money supply will expand as banks loan out money and people deposit the proceeds of the loans. if demand or supply for loans dries up, more cash will sit on bank's balance sheets and there will be less money overall. printing money can effect this - it gooses the supply of money to grow when market forces are pushing it to contract. and likewise burning money (what the fed does when they want to raise rates) does the opposite. the reason to do this is to prevent deflation (falling prices) and the attendant [debt deflation spiral](>all the buildings, all the work, everything tangible and intangible that has value. we are going to call this 1 unit of value that we will call 1 gdp-v. note, this is not a dollar amount. this is a concept of value. now all of that value gets denoted as dollars. this is how we think of actual gdp. that's not what gdp is. gdp is not the stock of value, but the flow in any given year. the value of a building is not a part of gdp. >when the federal reserve prints money, they add to the total number of dollars in existence. this adds to the total supply of money, thus deluting its value slightly over time, obviously we know this as deflation. first, it depends on the money multiplier and market forces as i said above. and pretty sure you meant to say inflation, not deflation. >however, if you think about all of this as that gdp-v, that actual value, the concept switches a bit. so think of 1 gpd-v as one un-movable concept in your mind. it can't be moved by the amount of money, because it is just the sum of the value of the work, not the amount of dollars or money that is involved. correct, for the most part changing prices do not impact real output - except for the incentive effects that can cause people to make more or less stuff. that aggregate value you are talking about is not static after all. >so if this gdp-v remains constant, what effect does this money that they print have, since it is representative of the value of what we do? it does not remain constant. if there is an economic depression, there is a real destruction of wealth. people being unemployed means that potential labor is being wasted. buildings being abandoned means that capital is being wasted. etc. the point of printing money is to get those resources to work, and not have them be wasted.",cqsxoxn,2667.9641257661046,1,1430336973,83,22,-24167,0,72.52791976013708,515.0,724.0,34.0,141,0.029411764705882353,0.029411764705882353,0.08823529411764706,0.29411764705882354,0.0,0.0,0.029411764705882353,0.0,0.029411764705882353,0.0,0.0,0.029411764705882353,0.029411764705882353,0.029411764705882353,0.5882352941176471,0.09486254486254486,0.23883495145631067,0.0,0,0.0,525,68.60,50.00,11.24,68.89,16.41,15.43,83.81,52.19,11.43,3.05,0.19,0.95,0.95,0.00,0.95,8.38,8.00,13.14,9.52,3.81,7.81,2.29,14.10,3.24,3.05,1.71,0.95,4.95,3.43,2.86,0.57,0.00,0.19,0.38,5.33,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,13.71,2.29,2.86,1.33,3.43,2.48,4.76,0.57,0.00,0.38,0.19,0.38,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.38,6.86,0.95,1.14,3.81,0.76,0.19,1.14,12.57,1.33,7.81,1.52,3.62,2.67,3.05,0.00,0.00,8.38,0.00,0.00,0.19,0.00,0.19,0.00,0.00,0.00,17.33,6.10,4.38,0.00,0.00,0.38,0.00,1.33,0.00,0.76,1.90,2.48

t3_3i4032,"i never understood the appeal of psychedelics until i tried lsd(and that's what the majority of my comment will focus on because i do not have much experience with other psychedelics, though i tried mdma once and it was alright), it was a spur of the moment thing on new years eve. it is something i would almost always recommend to someone as it is completely different than anything else in the world. imagine the craziest dream you have ever had, lsd is nothing like that. imagine the most absurd feeling you have ever had, lsd is nothing like that. lsd is just... different. it is an adventure in a lot of ways, and it effects everyone differently because it is profoundly influenced by your mental state. the feeling of being on acid is absolutely indescribable, in many ways it is seeing the world for the first time, not just in a completely different light, but a perspective that simply cannot be described by the english language or really any form of communication there is. it is a way not to escape or feel indescribable pleasure or cope, it is a way to see things differently. i admit, it has the potential to be very scary. people do have bad trips, but i would argue that the potential psychological gains far outweigh the risks of a bad trip. psychedelics can open one's eyes in a way that's beyond this world. when you spend 8-12 hours in the middle of a very profound and strange experience, when you reemerge into the unaltered state of mind it is truly fantastically strange and in many ways a joyous experience even though the trip has ended. there is a reason why it is called a trip, not simply because you see crazy shit or because you go on an adventure. lsd was a journey through the depths of my mind and the world around me in a way that i had never before thought possible. there's a couple studies that have shown that lsd can greatly help with sufferers of addiction and anxiety. i will link a few below, if you would like to read them. unfortunately there has not been much study in recent years, due to it being illegal and all.

[this is a major problem among veterans now, as va hospitals prescribe opioids to treat ptsd](these prescription drugs often get individuals addicted, and soon enough they are buying the street equivalent and shooting it in their veins like the 'junkies' we are all afraid of becoming. but moving on... > my view on psychedelic drugs such as lsd, and some of the 'partying' drugs like mdma, are irrational. this causes me distress when people i know take them. i would like to have my view changed, as it is putting stress on my relationship. this is not completely irrational. mdma is typically cut with heroin and cocaine, and besides it does burn a hole in the dopamine receptors causing life long chemically derived depression. lsd, and mushrooms are not social drugs. they are, if anything, anti social drugs. i have taken quite a bit of both of these and have never found myself comfortable in any location not natural. lsd and mushrooms are not for fun, they are for profound life changing insights. you need to be in a stable psychological state before you take them and you should be in a natural setting, or at the very least someplace comfortable and non-threatening. these are not physical drugs like opioids, cocaine, ect... they are psychological drugs and can be used for profound revelations. nobody should ever eat mushrooms and then go to a reggae concert or rave. thats a nightmare. i would not worry about your partner unless these are rituals or habits. once a year shroom trips are pretty healthy, as far as i am concerned, and even taking mdma on rare occasions and going clubbing is not cause for concern. for a much more detailed description on psychedelics try reading or aldous huxley's book the doors of perception",cud6ct8,513.2176256532488,1,1440367690,30,8,6066,0,65.70405816344012,449.0,656.0,26.0,2,0.038461538461538464,0.0,0.15384615384615385,0.07692307692307693,0.0,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.038461538461538464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11538461538461539,0.0,0.46153846153846156,0.07324098124098125,0.27616926503340755,0.0,0,0.0,450,47.62,48.22,33.50,9.41,16.67,21.56,87.78,53.56,12.89,8.44,3.56,0.22,2.67,0.00,2.00,4.44,5.11,12.67,10.89,4.67,8.44,2.22,16.22,5.56,3.33,1.11,0.89,2.44,7.33,2.89,4.22,1.78,0.22,1.33,6.67,0.00,0.22,0.00,0.00,14.89,2.89,1.78,2.22,3.56,1.56,4.22,2.00,0.44,0.22,1.11,7.56,0.67,6.67,0.00,0.44,4.89,1.33,0.89,0.67,1.11,1.11,1.33,12.89,1.11,10.00,2.00,4.89,3.11,0.89,2.00,0.22,0.22,0.22,0.22,0.44,0.00,0.00,0.44,0.00,0.00,15.33,6.67,5.11,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.22,0.00,1.78,0.22,1.33

t3_2uyc2l,"a lot of people in this thread are taking your viewpoint to a bit of an extreme - i do not actually think your advocating pussy-eating classes. i think you have a point in that ""safe sex"" is taught from a purely physical and medical standpoint (condoms, birth control, etc) with not much emphasis on the emotional or psychological side. i believe that is largely due to many reasons that people have brought up in this thread - the immaturity or otherwise of teenagers, the difficulty of pinning down what is ""good"" sex, the danger of pushing a certain type of sexual activity as ""normal"", etc etc. i understand why educators would shy away from teaching improvement or experimentation for these reasons, but you are correct in saying this leaves us with a sexual health program that could be considered deficient. i wanted to bring up my high school sex ed classes because i think they may bridge that gap. we worked with a group called ""condomania"" that came around once a year to hold mandatory workshops for students from grade 8 to 10. the teachers were not involved, and the condomania staff were all in their early twenties, energetic, funny, and irreverent, which put a lot of the students at ease and allowed them to open up a bit more with their questions. all the workshops included jokes, skits, quizzes, group discussions and (most importantly, imo) a box where students could submit anonymous questions to be answered at the end. the grade 8 work shop was about consent and respect for your partner. this didn't necessarily branch into technique - all the staff had to do was emphasize how important it is to listen to your partner, respect their choices and desires above all else. we were told not to expect anything of anyone that they weren't prepared to give. the grade 9 work shop was about sexual health and family planning - condoms, birth control, stds, diagrams of the uterus, timelines of fetal development, the whole nine yards. we were also taught how to put on a male condom, and how to apply lubricant. we were told it was important to use condoms for vaginal, anal, and oral intercourse, and it was also important to change condoms in between different types of intercourse with the same partner. we were taught how to apply dental dams and female condoms. we talked about masturbation, and even about sex toys, although without much detail. no one of these things was emphasized more than the other, which made all of them equally ""normal"" or ""acceptable"". we were taught how to experiment safely without being told to go experiment. the grade 10 workshop was about gender roles. in this workshop we were encouraged to roleplay different scenarios such as ""picking someone up"" at a bar, or ""going on a date"", or ""meeting the parents"", and examine the different expectations for men and women in these scenes. we discussed the different barriers that the lgtbq community faces, and how to be respectful of people's gender presentation in all circumstances, not just sexual. i do not recall discussing sex much at all in this workshop, but the connection was certainly made between having a strong sense of sexual identity, and having good and safe sex. i feel like this succeeded for two reasons: teenagers are smart, and if you try and tell them how to run their lives they will stop listening to you. if any of these people had told me sexual experimentation is good for me, i would have reacted as though i had just been told abstinence is good for me - namely, ""you do not know what is good for me"". which is, i believe, the correct reaction. no one should be pushed one way or the other, whether by religiosity, shaming, or health reasons. instead, give them all the information they require, allow them to explore gender and identity in a safe setting, emphasize respect and safety, and they will be able to make the journey on their own. as a disclaimer, i grew up in a liberal canadian city with a large gay population that was fairly well represented within the school, so while this class was received well in my community i am not sure how it would do in more conservative areas.",codgr1k,2204.657003106243,1,1423257794,135,19,60121,0,52.65555069930073,715.0,1084.0,28.0,3,0.07142857142857142,0.03571428571428571,0.10714285714285714,0.10714285714285714,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.0,0.07142857142857142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07142857142857142,0.03571428571428571,0.0,0.5357142857142856,0.03802068785728916,0.25874125874125875,0.0,0,0.0,721,70.31,64.61,39.59,92.36,25.75,21.78,90.15,52.43,12.34,7.35,2.64,1.39,1.25,0.00,2.08,4.99,6.52,14.98,8.46,4.02,7.77,1.94,15.40,4.58,2.22,2.22,1.66,3.47,5.27,4.72,0.55,0.14,0.00,0.00,11.10,0.28,0.55,0.28,0.28,16.78,3.19,3.88,1.66,3.05,2.22,5.27,0.69,0.00,0.42,0.14,4.72,0.69,1.80,3.19,0.28,10.82,2.77,1.11,4.85,1.11,1.11,5.96,6.52,1.11,9.99,2.22,6.24,1.66,4.99,0.83,0.14,0.28,0.14,0.00,0.42,0.14,0.00,0.00,0.28,0.00,15.40,3.88,6.80,0.14,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.83,2.77,0.42,0.55,0.00

t3_3e811o,"i am only going to challenge this for the part where: >i believe the only difference between a romantic relationship and a friendship/platonic relationship is physical attraction. and it is not going to be about mystical forces or destiny or any such nonsense. it is going to be about my own crude understanding of modern neuroscience. the part you are missing in the above description is that romantic love also has two other key components in most tests, which i will call **prioritization** and **interconnection**. i'll start with the latter because it is harder to catch, but easier to visualize: **interconnection** is how much your thoughts about x are connected to other thoughts. in simplified terms, whenever you think of ""ice cream"", your neurons will also send signals to other nearby concepts, such as the taste associated with ice cream, memories related to ice cream, images, coldness, and so on, and this propagates through a network of concepts and memories in your brain. with a normal person that you spend a lot of time with, that ""person"" in your mind is actually a lot of different concepts and nodes that connect to a lot of other things, and their name and face are only small parts of that. when you think about that girl lorraine the model, you are more likely to trigger the neurons in your brain related to the color pink because you know she likes pink, and she often wears it, so the connections between the nodes that contain your mental model of lorraine are more closely connected with the nodes that fire off when you think of the color pink, than if you were to think about george the office guy. with someone that you are starting to get romantically attracted to, beyond the simple physical lust/attraction, it is frequently observed that you will also start... ""enlarging"" the network of connections from that person-concept to other concepts and memories in your brain, so that ""they"" connect to more things in your mind... and more other things in your mind connect to ""them"". to visualize this, look at [this graph here](and imagine this graph represents concepts in your mind. green are clear concepts (""walking"", ""ice cream"", etc.), beige are specific memory data, and yellow are persons. naturally this image is not actually about neurons in brains, but it serves for this illustration. notice the one yellow node that is so much more connected than the other yellow nodes? how it has many more memory/experience connections, but also due to its larger share of space is connected to more green concepts as well? that's the person you are getting romantically attracted to. **prioritization** is simpler. it is when some concept in your mind has more affect associated with it, and thus holds higher *value*. it is frequently observed in tests that subjects will pay a higher cost to protect their so / subject of romantic love than would be explained by the simple combination of platonic relationship and physical attraction. it is also harder to visualize, because it is not a linear number that you can just add up... letting that person cry for a few hours alone is still less negatively valued than letting your brother die, for instance. however, to take the graph analogy above, when a moral or hedonistic calculation goes through the nodes for this person, the resulting choice will weigh more heavily in that direction if the subject was one you were romantically attracted to than if the subject were only someone you were lusting for and had a platonic relationship with. in other words, it also depends on how much space they occupy in your mental map (measured by how often thinking about something else makes you also think about them) and how much emotion is generated when they are involved (measured by how long you spend crying if they tell you you are stupid vs someone else tells you you are stupid... or preferably some other, less painful method). not just how much you interact with them, how much you trust them or how much you want to fuck them.",ctcjrd5,227.3655748002126,1,1437600966,42,14,10241,0,53.08757536606376,688.0,1040.0,27.0,6,0.25925925925925924,0.037037037037037035,0.18518518518518517,0.2222222222222222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07407407407407407,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.0,0.07407407407407407,0.0,0.0,0.888888888888889,0.034898434898434895,0.2194767441860465,0.0,0,0.0,693,47.14,83.32,29.38,61.34,26.65,20.78,86.15,55.70,16.02,7.79,0.72,0.00,5.19,0.29,1.59,8.23,5.34,14.72,7.65,8.08,9.09,0.72,13.13,7.07,4.04,2.45,0.43,4.33,4.62,3.17,1.30,0.00,0.43,0.58,11.54,0.14,0.14,0.43,0.29,14.29,3.32,2.89,1.01,3.46,0.29,5.48,2.89,2.02,0.00,0.58,3.46,1.30,0.58,0.43,0.87,4.33,2.16,0.14,1.15,0.58,0.29,1.44,10.10,1.44,9.52,1.01,5.77,2.74,1.01,0.00,0.00,0.58,0.14,0.14,0.29,0.14,0.00,0.00,0.14,0.00,17.46,4.76,5.05,0.29,0.00,0.29,0.00,0.14,2.02,0.29,1.01,3.61

t3_32br6b,"i have a couple of arguments for you. **government as neutral assessor/guaranteer of safety** most people agree that there is a role for government in inspecting food, drugs, products to ensure that what is promised is the same as what is delivered, and that consumers can expect a base level of quality. strong libertarians will argue that the market will take care of this, but rather than see who dies of e coli and then boycotting the sources of the tainted food, proactive government monitoring makes sense to most people. to use your paragliding example, there is a role in monitoring and punishing a company that claims to use a titanium frame but actually uses a more failure-prone aluminum frame. the question is what happens when an inherently unsafe product is offered? should a company be able to market a paper airplane you strap to your back, which has a 100% failure rate? i suppose the government could put on a label that says, ""warning, use of this product will result in death"", but most people think that a product that is that inherently dangerous should not be legal. after that point, it is really a question of where you draw the ""how dangerous is too dangerous"" line - including with recreational drugs. **whose life is it anyway** if you are a single person living in a cabin in montana, it really does not matter what you do as far as i am concerned. but that's rarely the case. as a society, we have decided to have a safety net. if you scramble your brains oding on some junk, society ma end up paying for your care for the rest of your life. we are going to pay for your kids. there's the cost to the guy who you crash into while driving high. or when your addictions suck up all your money, again, we might be paying for your kids. few actions ""don't hurt anyone else"" - and if society is impacted, your personal freedom has to be countered by the impact. **edit** i am getting a number of responses about drug laws, alcohol, prescription drugs, etc. i want to reiterate, i am not make a stand one way or another on drug legislation (although i think it is silly that pot is illegal and alcohol isn't), simply that there is a long established tradition of putting ""the overall good of society"" (however that is defined) over ""personal freedom"" (again, insert your definition here). where to draw the lines is certainly debatable, but no society gives personal freedom absolute weight over harm reduction.",cq9r1xc,482.3088939075412,1,1428849035,134,16,4387,0,57.00867016729761,431.0,646.0,19.0,130,0.10526315789473684,0.0,0.3684210526315789,0.6842105263157895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10526315789473684,0.10526315789473684,0.0,1.4210526315789473,0.0317738791423002,0.29930394431554525,0.0,0,0.0,434,62.27,80.29,14.86,29.63,22.84,20.51,87.10,53.92,13.36,6.45,1.61,0.69,4.15,0.00,0.00,6.91,8.06,12.44,10.37,5.30,6.22,1.38,15.67,5.76,2.76,3.00,0.69,2.30,7.14,3.23,3.00,0.00,0.92,0.69,11.98,0.23,0.23,0.23,0.23,14.29,1.61,3.23,2.07,3.46,1.38,5.07,1.15,0.23,0.23,0.46,3.69,0.23,2.76,0.00,1.15,6.68,0.92,0.69,3.23,0.69,2.07,0.23,13.13,1.61,8.53,1.38,5.07,2.30,5.07,0.69,0.00,1.84,0.00,0.46,0.69,0.23,0.00,0.23,0.00,0.23,18.43,3.92,5.53,0.00,0.00,0.46,0.00,0.69,2.30,0.92,1.38,3.23

t3_2xnhjl,"hmm, let me see if i can address a specific part of your argument. you claim that society's views, attitudes, and language surrounding rape of a female is a significant reason for the extremely traumatic experiences that many rape victims experience. i'd like to offer a counterargument. it is not the societal stigmas that surround rape that create this trauma, but rather the societal stigmas that surround sex in general. in this thread, many people have argued that rape is different from violent assault because sex is something extremely special. it is something that is only shared in absolute trust, with an intimate partner. and they are right. it absolutely changes things. the cultural norms surrounding sex, not rape, are responsible for the intense trauma. think about how differently men and women are taught about sex all over the world. men are viewed as the initiators, they are supposed to crave sex, they are supposed to go out there and seek it. a young man is praised by his peers and by society if he can get laid easily. there is a huge porn industry that provides men with more women to masturbate to than they are likely to talk to in their lives. this cultural view is especially evident in the reactions of some people to male rape. some people actually believe men can't be raped. others see a story about a high school boy having sex with a teacher and cheer on the guy like it is awesome. others say he must have enjoyed it. male rape is often ignored and dismissed. now women are raised very differently. women are told that sex is an extremely special and intimate thing. their fathers try to protect them from boys who might want to have sex with them. religion tells them that they need to save their virginity for marriage. their virginity is protected like family honor. in some cultures the female can quite literally be killed or at least imprisoned for having sex before marriage even if she is raped. sex is viewed as a secretive, dirty act (phrases like ""do the dirty"" referring to sex are quite common) and women often hide that they even have sex. society tells young women that they are supposed to not want to have sex as much as men. they are supposed to suppress their desires if a man has not courted them long enough. if they have sex too often, they are considered to be sluts and people say they are ""easy."" why is it a surprise then, that women experience extreme trauma from rape? they are convinced that sex is supposed to the something only given to that one person you love enough to marry and live the rest of your life with. some girls are actually afraid of sex because of all the social conditioning. others blame themselves when they get raped because society still wants to call them sluts. so i believe that it is the societal attitudes toward sex, and not toward rape, that make the experience so much more traumatic than a violent assault.",cp1s3ft,857.3255208203012,1,1425303242,424,71,17587,0,64.49253714753716,518.0,774.0,33.0,2,0.0,0.0,0.09090909090909091,0.12121212121212122,0.0,0.030303030303030304,0.030303030303030304,0.030303030303030304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030303030303030304,0.030303030303030304,0.0,0.36363636363636354,0.07826140873015873,0.2277992277992278,0.0,0,0.0,518,55.58,89.15,4.19,2.30,15.70,19.69,95.17,53.67,14.09,6.95,0.77,0.00,0.77,0.77,4.63,7.14,5.98,12.74,10.42,5.60,5.98,1.16,16.99,5.79,2.90,0.77,0.19,2.70,8.88,3.09,5.79,0.19,3.86,0.00,18.53,0.97,0.39,2.12,3.09,15.06,1.54,2.12,2.32,5.02,2.12,4.63,1.93,0.77,0.39,0.00,7.53,0.00,0.58,6.76,0.00,5.79,1.54,0.97,1.93,0.77,0.97,2.51,14.48,0.58,6.76,0.39,4.05,2.12,0.97,0.19,0.39,0.00,0.19,0.19,0.97,0.39,0.19,0.39,0.19,0.00,11.00,6.18,2.90,0.00,0.00,0.19,0.00,0.00,0.77,0.58,0.39,0.00

t3_3ax7py,"first of all your premise eliminates the main reason why people have a problem with the festival, but i will play along as best i can. the dog was domesticated somewhere between 15,000 and 30,000 years ago while man existed as a hunter gatherer, by comparison the cow, sheep, and pig was domesticated around 8,000 years ago and are tied with man's development of agriculture. so we have had a relationship with dogs for at least twice as long as any of the animals we use as a food source. this also shows that we never intended them as a livestock animal since we literally had not developed that concept at the time. 15,000 years ago man and wolves filled much the same niche and had many similarities, both traveled in nomadic packs hunting much the same animals, even our social structures are remarkably similar. it has been theorized that the domestication of wolves was not some thing we actively did but rather a gradual symbiosis. wolves fed on our scraps and wolves less aggressive to us thrived while more aggressive ones failed. wolves following our tribes served as a deterrent to larger predators and a free alarm system notifying us of any approaching threat. eventually we began to work together to bring down prey. wolves became dogs and we welcomed them into our huts and our families. at no point is there evidence of us using them directly as a food source except when no other sources were available. in fact meat eaters like dogs are terrible animals to use as direct food animals, every time you move up the food chain a step the amount of meat for resources required to create it diminishes dramatically. essentially it takes a given amount of energy to grow grass which comes from the sun, a pig eating that grass can only convert a small portion of that total energy into meat, and a dog eating that pig can only convert a even smaller portion of the energy from that meat into its own meat. carnivores are just not designed to put on weight like herbivores. for this reason actual farming of dogs is horribly inefficient and completely uneconomical. this is why so many of the dogs for this festival are kidnapped instead of farmed, it is the only truly viable way to provide that much meat. what is the purpose of growing perfectly edible meat to feed to dogs which will produce exponentially less meat than you originally fed them for a product (dog meat) that from everything i have heard is not exponentially better. since dogs make for terrible livestock instead we bred them to depend on us emotionally and to see us as members of their pack. dogs have several abilities which uniquely augment our own such as speed, loyalty, intelligence, sharper senses, and hunting ability. dogs and humans are the only animals that use visual cues to communicate, it certainly was not inherent in them before domestication and is not in any other domesticated animal showing that we viewed them as closer to equals to be communicated with than livestock to be slaughtered. we used these dogs to help us survive in a very harsh world by aiding us in hunting and protection. dogs literally put food on our table and watched over us while we slept for thousands of years. in recent years dogs have been much less critical to our success as a species but still provide many valuable functions. in a very real sense our species and theirs are for no better word ""married"" we have developed an bond, depended on, and provided for each other in a symbiotic relationship that goes far deeper than any other domesticated animal for tens of thousands of years. tl:dr essentially dogs were never intended to be livestock like pigs and cows. they would be horribly inefficient if we used them that way due to their carnivore nature, which means if a ready supply of pets to be stolen did not exist it is likely this festival would also not exist for lack of supply. a tradition of eating dog can only ever thrive on the immorality of stealing dogs or incredibly uneconomical waste of resources farming them. we also have a deep and inherent debt to them for protecting, feeding, and loving us for far longer than recorded human history. all of these things are unique to dogs and show why eating dog is not the same as eating pig, but rather a betrayal of all that they have done for us over the last 15-30 thousand years.",csh29h5,664.827474088859,1,1435159421,585,54,5510,0,47.464705882352945,765.0,1199.0,29.0,1,0.10344827586206896,0.034482758620689655,0.3103448275862069,0.2413793103448276,0.0,0.0,0.034482758620689655,0.034482758620689655,0.0,0.0,0.06896551724137931,0.0,0.13793103448275862,0.0,0.9655172413793103,0.09566638718424433,0.24836601307189543,0.0,0,0.0,776,76.11,79.52,18.95,47.20,26.76,19.20,81.96,51.29,12.24,6.96,0.39,4.25,0.39,0.00,1.93,5.15,5.80,16.11,6.83,4.77,6.83,1.80,11.21,6.44,5.67,1.16,1.93,3.61,4.77,2.96,1.80,0.52,0.52,0.13,9.54,0.26,0.00,0.00,0.39,11.08,0.90,3.22,1.03,1.68,1.93,3.74,1.55,0.64,0.26,0.39,3.35,0.13,0.13,0.00,3.09,10.44,6.31,1.68,1.80,1.03,0.90,3.99,6.70,0.52,11.73,1.55,5.93,4.25,1.42,1.29,1.03,0.26,0.13,0.13,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,7.86,3.74,3.22,0.13,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.13,0.26,0.13,0.26,0.00

t3_3bqwex,"> i can't help feeling that it is a rather useless cause. i do not think it is. every field that is dominantly one gender over another is going to miss out on talented people with novel insights. we should not miss out on a qualified nurse because some bloke was told it was not a manly profession. neither should we miss out on a qualified scientists because some girl was told science was for boys. unless you have a good argument as for why certain genders are almost universally better at certain professions any sort of gender imbalance is going to cause society missing out on qualified people in the right place. and i think the police force is a special case, in this regard. i have seen firsthand how some people react to both male and female police officers and having a good gender balance is going to help civilians a lot. a lot of people are more comfortable discussing certain things with people from their own gender. children will gravitate towards female police officers (and yes, this is also due to harmful gender roles in society, but we need a police that functions in the society we live in, not in the society we would like to live in). > they involve so-called ""positive discrimination"", which leads to cases where a candidate gets ahead of a fitter one only because the former is a woman. people often say this when talking about this, but i do not think this is completely true. we know from several studies that when applying for, well, anything, people are discriminated against based on their gender, skin color, sexuality, etc. even if the resumes are completely identical, this still happens. so if a woman wants to enter a male dominated field, there is a good chance she has going to have to be **more** qualified than a man. positive discrimination is intended to get (in this case) women accepted when they are ""merely"" equally qualified. > they do not solve the real issue, which is the discrimination that would have stopped the women from getting the job. they may be able to overcome it thanks to external help, but even if we have solved the symptoms the problem is still there. and as soon as we have good, viable way to stop the discrimination from happening at all, we should implement that. unfortunately, we do not have one and we will have to make do with measures we can actually implement.",csompka,635.896066156017,1,1435759597,451,27,-23669,0,60.4499230769231,416.0,616.0,20.0,6,0.1,0.0,0.3,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05,0.0,0.05,0.05,0.0,0.8000000000000002,0.05112781954887218,0.23317307692307693,0.0,0,0.0,417,61.13,79.93,20.55,57.51,20.85,19.66,90.89,55.40,11.27,6.00,1.20,2.88,0.24,0.24,1.44,5.28,7.19,13.67,11.75,6.00,6.24,2.16,20.62,4.56,2.64,1.92,0.72,3.36,6.95,4.32,2.64,0.00,0.72,1.20,13.43,0.00,0.00,1.92,1.20,17.27,2.16,3.60,2.88,3.60,2.40,4.80,1.20,0.48,0.24,0.48,1.44,0.24,0.96,0.24,0.00,11.03,3.60,2.16,3.84,2.40,0.72,2.88,13.67,2.40,11.03,1.68,6.24,3.12,4.08,0.24,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.48,0.00,0.00,0.24,0.24,0.00,13.43,4.80,4.56,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.24,0.96,0.24,0.96,1.68

t3_3csjl0,"the traditional ""long division"" edqh algorithm serves three major benefits to students: 1. it is one of the earlier introductions the concept of breaking down a math problem into smaller parts, at a point in the school curriculum where that's still a useful, important, and somewhat novel lesson. 2. it helps to introduce the concept of decimal points and tie those back to fractions, which usually come shortly before long division in the math curriculum. 3. it is a logical introduction to the concept of a remainder, which is actually very situationally useful and i think underemphasized in common-use math. i'll probably never do long division by hand again, much the same way i will probably never do a riemann sum by hand again. (maybe if i am doing a computer program that's emphasizing speedy output over accuracy?) but learning the concept is helpful for establishing understanding and building the groundwork for learning later concepts. conversely, square roots as a concept come much later in the math curriculum. by that point, the edsrh algorithm is not introducing any new mathematical concepts?students know how to break problems down into smaller parts, they know how decimal points work, and they have plenty of practice with multiplication, division, and usually even exponents. the edsrh algorithm is essentially a framework for the guess-and-check method of finding a square root. it is a novelty, and maybe one worth teaching as a footnote, but hardly something worth testing.",csykg61,607.5260258149686,1,1436540516,126,30,4676,0,44.814782748632155,239.0,405.0,13.0,27,0.15384615384615385,0.0,0.3076923076923077,0.23076923076923078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15384615384615385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23076923076923078,0.0,1.0769230769230769,0.03654970760233918,0.301255230125523,0.0,0,0.0,246,84.14,38.79,56.30,56.48,18.92,28.86,79.27,49.19,6.91,2.44,1.63,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.81,4.47,10.57,12.60,6.50,8.94,6.10,1.22,10.98,5.69,3.66,2.03,2.44,2.03,3.25,2.44,0.81,0.00,0.00,0.00,2.03,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,14.23,3.66,2.03,1.22,4.88,1.22,2.03,1.63,0.81,0.00,0.81,0.81,0.81,0.00,0.00,0.00,7.32,1.63,0.81,3.66,0.41,0.81,0.41,9.35,0.81,15.85,0.81,8.94,5.69,8.54,0.41,0.00,0.81,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,15.45,4.88,5.69,0.41,0.00,0.41,0.00,1.22,0.81,1.22,0.81,0.00
t3_3anzqm,"my answer will be from the perspective of a university student in the uk, so it might not apply directly to the us. low numbers of right-leaning students and faculty at universities is but a symptom of a far larger problem; politicism or political discrimination. this is a problem that will not be solved by affirmative action because there are other disincentives for right-leaning people to express their views anywhere. **part 1: politicism outside university** our recent general election, and the surprise conservative victory, lead to an outpouring of hatred and discrimination directed at the prime minister, mps and voters who 'voted wrong'. not even one day had passed before it descended into violence in the streets of the capital.

[here's just one of them.](**part 4: why affirmative action is insufficient** affirmative action is supposed to be a last resort effort to increase inclusion after anti-discrimination measures have been tried. unfortunately, there has been zero attempt to prevent political discrimination at university. if anything, it seems actively encouraged. until that encouragement is ended and regular support avenues for non-left students are set up affirmative action will do nothing. my personal recommendations for the uk: * at a national level, set up a competitor to the nus. there are a handful of student unions that have chosen to separate from the nus due to it is radicalism that could work together to form this. it would be politically neutral. * prevent the nus from enforcing censorship policies. * fire faculty and reprimand students who partake in or encourage discrimination towards anyone who is right-leaning. * crackdown on the currently legitimized and even supported anti-semetic and anti-israeli policies enacted at universities. * create a system by which students can report politicism, preferably at a level above universities instead of at the university itself because of the likelihood that such a system would be co-opted to deny right-leaning students access to it. * ensure that progenitors of conservative ideology, such as edmund burke, are studied alongside the progenitors of socialist ideology where relevant even prior to university level. * remove communist agitprop (such as ""an inspector calls"") from the english literature gcse. if, after enacting all these policies and waiting 20 years, there is still a severe leftist slant in uk academia, then affirmative action would be worth considering as a last resort.",cseek90,515.8012098655616,1,1434945530,94,21,3084,0,34.583846624931994,835.0,1510.0,44.0,3,0.0,0.0,0.13636363636363635,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045454545454545456,0.0,0.0,0.022727272727272728,0.0,0.045454545454545456,0.0,0.7499999999999999,0.07227113971300017,0.2970059880239521,0.0,0,0.0,874,85.45,48.63,34.75,10.05,21.85,30.43,79.41,46.91,7.67,2.40,1.37,0.23,0.34,0.00,0.46,5.26,7.89,13.27,8.58,4.58,4.81,1.26,12.47,4.81,1.49,0.80,2.52,1.49,4.00,1.26,2.52,0.34,1.03,0.23,4.46,0.11,0.00,0.23,0.11,9.61,1.49,2.40,1.49,2.40,1.03,2.75,1.60,0.46,0.80,0.34,0.69,0.23,0.23,0.23,0.11,9.50,1.72,1.49,5.49,0.34,1.26,3.20,7.67,0.57,14.53,1.83,9.73,3.32,7.67,0.57,0.11,0.11,0.23,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,20.59,5.03,3.78,0.57,0.23,0.00,0.00,2.17,1.37,0.57,1.72,5.15

t3_3c7i98,"i think what you have identified is simply that there are socially sanctioned relationship preferences, and socially unsanctioned preferences, depending on context. for instance, a man can have an internal, silent preference for lean women, but depending on the context, if he vocalizes it, he is likely to receive criticism. women who have a preference for tall men tend to face less open criticism for that preference, even when voiced openly. both genders tend to not be criticized for openly wanting an intelligent and/or successful partner, in the same way that both genders are essentially never criticized for not wanting a dumb loser. these socially accepted preferences change over time, and what you are identifying is a universally condemned attribute transitioning out of that realm. for most of history, sexual promiscuity in women has been universally condemnable, and so it is not unexpected to have a large portion of people who still ascribe to that social custom. as customs go, there is no ""correct"" viewpoint. as western society has grown more progressive, this particularly female heavy bias against promiscuity has begun to equalize, and we are simply in the tumultuous transition period. there are plenty of people who say it makes zero difference in their choice, and plenty of people who only consider someone who is a virgin. both are merely choices. as far as your view goes, i do not necessarily disagree with your position, but i disagree with your oversimplification. slut is a subjective term. ask 10 people what it means and the only common thread will be sexual promiscuity. there will be a wide range of pejorative attitudes about the term, but the problem lies in the fact that it is exclusively an insult that gets wrongly applied to people with multiple sexual partners. consider a young woman, who is 32, and has had only serious boyfriends her whole life. she started dating at 16, lost her virginity to her first boyfriend, and has had a sexual relationship with each of her boyfriends, with a consistent duration of approximately 18-24 months per bf. this gives her a sexual partner range of 8-11 (rounding up). now, to many people, the number 11 could seem like a high ""slutty"" number, when in reality she has merely had a long string of moderately long, monogamous relationships, that even allow for something as conservative as a 6-month waiting period before sex. consider another person, who had one serious relationship at 16, lost their virginity, broke up when she went to college, and then drunkenly slept with 5 guys in her first year. the next year she met her college sweetheart, and they stayed together for 12 years before breaking up. she is now roughly as old as the first woman, yet has only 7 partners. however, the means at which she got to her 7 as opposed the the other woman's 11 is monumentally different. so while it does not necessarily mean nothing, it is a worthless metric without context. as both those women have had very different sexual pasts, and if you were taking either one of them on a date at 32, their respective pasts would mean very different things to you. now, to bring it back to the word slut, you can see how using that word to describe either of them would mean **very** different things. one of them had a very slow accumulation of partners through 1.5-2 year relationships, and the other had the vast majority of all her partners during one short burst in college, with the previous decade+ being solely monogamous.",cst34iw,308.8856731462038,1,1436129860,270,23,-13791,0,49.8197192046249,583.0,931.0,27.0,16,0.037037037037037035,0.0,0.25925925925925924,0.2962962962962963,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.0,0.07407407407407407,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.0,0.0,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.8518518518518519,0.09244270686578379,0.2538593481989708,0.0,0,0.0,602,67.14,82.82,30.50,1.36,23.15,22.09,87.71,51.50,12.46,5.98,0.50,0.17,1.33,2.82,1.16,6.48,6.31,13.95,8.64,5.65,6.31,1.50,14.62,7.97,4.15,2.49,4.32,3.32,4.49,0.66,3.82,0.00,1.16,0.83,14.78,0.00,2.16,3.82,1.50,12.13,3.49,1.33,2.33,1.83,1.33,4.15,1.00,0.33,0.50,0.17,3.32,0.33,0.17,2.66,0.17,7.81,3.99,1.16,1.99,0.83,0.17,3.49,10.47,0.50,14.95,1.50,6.81,7.14,0.66,0.17,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.83,0.66,0.17,0.00,0.00,0.00,14.29,4.32,7.14,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.66,0.66,0.17,0.33,1.00

t3_36utu6,"instead of assuming that these people do not understand how the internet works, you might try considering the possibility that you have not given enough thought to the way *privacy* works. what does it mean to have privacy? the definition i like best (credit to [helen nissenbaum](holds that it means having a certain degree of control over information about oneself. that control can be achieved in a number of different ways. your home is generally a private place by default, because access is physically restricted to those who are invited inside. but the privacy of your home is not contingent on the fact that people are not able to get through your door without a key. the fact that it is understood as a private space leads to a generally acknowledged *expectation* of privacy that demands the respect of others by way of an unspoken social contract, so that you feel your right to privacy has been violated when someone on the roof of the neighboring building peers into your bedroom window through binoculars. another form of privacy is that which we expect to have in otherwise public spaces, even when we are completely surrounded by strangers. think about what it is like to have a conversation in a crowded restaurant. although it is true that everyone around you can easily eavesdrop, you are not speaking to them, and the social norms governing that situation dictate that they should ignore you. if someone were to sit nearby and actively listen to you and your friends without having been invited, you would probably feel that your privacy was not being properly respected. online social media spaces are a lot like that. everybody has access, but having access is not the same thing as having an invitation. do you remember how upset people were when facebook first rolled out the news feed? none of the things being displayed there were shown to people who didn't already have access to them, but the architecture of the virtual space had been radically altered. exchanging wall posts used to be like having a private conversation in a restaurant. suddenly, it was more like *performing* a conversation on a stage, in full view of a room full of people who were actively paying attention. check out [danah boyd's article](on the facebook community's reaction to that event. when people call you a creep for knowing about something they have shared on facebook, what they are really upset about is the fact that you have misunderstood your relationship with them and that information. you may have had access to it, but it was not meant for you. you have joined a conversation to which you weren't invited. being able to recognize the difference between a conversation that you are allowed to join and one you are supposed to ignore even when it is happening right in front of you is a social skill that is just as important online as it is in real life.",crhdevz,643.1790294083523,1,1432302333,187,48,15231,0,53.34546872141942,497.0,767.0,22.0,6,0.0,0.045454545454545456,0.22727272727272727,0.22727272727272727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09090909090909091,0.0,0.0,0.045454545454545456,0.0,0.0,0.6363636363636364,0.05165732959850607,0.25553319919517103,0.0,0,0.0,499,53.03,89.28,26.51,52.06,22.68,22.24,89.58,61.32,16.83,7.21,0.20,0.40,5.21,0.20,1.20,9.62,7.82,15.23,13.03,5.01,5.01,2.61,18.44,3.21,2.61,3.01,0.40,0.80,3.41,2.40,1.00,0.40,0.20,0.00,14.43,0.00,0.40,0.00,0.00,15.63,4.01,1.80,1.00,3.01,1.60,4.81,1.20,0.40,0.40,0.40,1.00,0.00,0.40,0.00,0.60,9.42,4.21,2.00,2.40,1.60,0.00,4.61,11.02,0.80,9.42,0.20,7.21,2.00,1.80,1.00,1.40,0.60,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,10.42,4.01,2.61,0.00,0.00,0.40,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.80,0.60,2.00

t3_36utu6,"i really do not think it is possible to ""change your view"" on this, because ""creeping"" is such an ambiguous word. there is definitely a colloquial use of ""creeping"" that does not imply anything negative. also, it is frequently thrown around in a sarcastic manner, or simply as a joke. this really has to be broken down into a case-by-case basis, and even then, you might just be misunderstanding somebody. i will say that i think ""creeping"" is thrown around more casually these days in that specific context because of the ubiquity of social networks. *everybody* has a facebook page, and most people have so many facebook friends that 80% of the content their friends post never even makes it to their timeline. so with that in mind, depending on what specifically you mention as having seen on somebody's facebook, that almost automatically implies that you put in an effort above and beyond simply becoming facebook friends and passively monitoring your own personal timeline. it may be a trivial amount of effort, but if somebody becomes aware of the fact that you actively searched through their profile in particular, it is unsettling to some degree... again, this is highly contextual. nobody wants to suddenly realize that the person they just became facebook friends with yesterday poured through 5 years of their history and actually paid enough attention to bring up something that happened years ago. the actual act of quickly scanning a new friend's profile is not really weird, but you have to admit, in a real life social situation, it is a bit awkward to bring something up from it that you weren't personally involved in that happened a long time ago. it just makes you seem like you are coming on really strong. also, i think in most people's minds, there is still a disconnect between social networks and reality. sometimes it is just a bit unsettling to realize that everything you put on social media reaches a much larger audience than you might have *really* intended for it to, harmless or not. so there are a number of reasons for some people reacting negatively to bringing up something from a social network. i am not sure that really changes your view at all, but it is an interesting discussion.",crhkv7d,514.7417325543505,1,1432317825,187,48,30723,0,48.25927631578949,380.0,604.0,16.0,4,0.1875,0.0,0.25,0.5625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0625,0.0,1.1875,0.048831908831908834,0.24210526315789474,0.0,0,0.0,384,46.82,75.10,68.89,25.77,24.00,24.48,89.32,59.90,16.41,5.99,1.30,0.00,3.39,0.00,1.30,10.42,5.99,14.84,8.59,9.11,5.73,2.60,15.10,3.91,2.34,0.26,0.52,2.86,3.91,1.56,1.56,0.78,0.26,0.00,12.50,0.00,1.04,0.00,0.00,20.05,3.65,3.65,0.52,6.51,2.34,5.21,1.56,1.30,0.26,0.00,0.26,0.00,0.26,0.00,0.00,6.25,3.65,0.52,2.08,0.00,0.00,3.12,10.42,1.82,14.32,2.86,6.51,4.95,0.52,1.56,0.00,0.26,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,14.32,4.69,4.69,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.52,2.08,1.04,0.00,1.30

t3_33th8a,"if we ignore the social issues here, there is an underlying problem with the genetics and evolutionary aspect of this whole situation. if we genetically modify one gene in an individual that would otherwise die of a genetic disorder, then this is good. we have fixed a mutation and allowed someone to live who otherwise wouldn't. i am fully in support of this. when we get into modifying things like attractiveness, intelligence, and athletic ability we run into serious problems with genetic diversity. depending on the number of genes that we modify, then we could end up with a population that was, for all intents and purposes, inbred. low genetic diversity means an inability to adapt to a changing environment (especially the microbial/pathogen environment) and could lead to all sorts of huge problems for the human race. now let us talk about the examples you give: attractiveness, intelligence, and athleticism. we'll start with athleticism. let us say you want your child to be an olympic athlete. you obviously want to upgrade the genes involved in muscle development and the cardiovascular system, but you also need to change your child's body type. you do not see olympic athletes with stubby legs, tiny arms, and low height, so let us fix that in our child. what genes do we modify to do this? we pretty much have to go with the hox genes here, and if you know anything about genetics or evolution you may start to see the problem with this. the hox genes get expressed extremely early in development (when we are still a disc) and basically set up the entire body from head to tail as well as all of our limbs. mutations in hox genes can result in entire body segments being duplicated at the expense of another segment being lost. if you start changing these hox genes, you affect every single downstream gene that hox plays a role in (we're talking thousands of genes here). so while you may get a tall child with long legs and long arms, you will no doubt have far reaching consequences. onto intelligence! it is a pretty similar situation. very early development processes set up neural connections, and a lot of it is random. essentially, we build a ton of neurons and kind of just send them out. the ones that find a target (the muscle or another neuron) and function go ahead and get to survive. the ones that do not reach a target apoptose and die. so the element of randomness makes it difficult to modify genes to increase neural connections and intelligence. we also do not really know of an ""intelligence"" gene, and most likely a whole suite of genes is involved in ""intelligence."" similar to hox, you start to mess with all these genes and funny things will happen. one quick thing about attractiveness because this is getting long and i need to go to do actual work. facial structure is a result of these cells called neural crest cells migrating to the face and forming cartilage. as these neural crest cells migrate through the body, they pass through certain regions and get identity signals from those regions. what provides those identity signals? hox. these neural crest cells get hox identity from whatever region they move through on the way around the body. the neural crest cells who move to the face will get the signal to form facial cartilage and go do just that. however, if we have previously modified hox in the endeavor to make our child athletic, we might run into problems with these modified hox genes causing the neural crest cells to function poorly and give rise to a deformed face (or even a nonfunctioning face). this is one example of the far-reaching consequences of hox modification, but it also shows how linked these developmental processes are. you can't just modify one gene and expect it to make someone athletic. you need to modify *a metric fuckton* of genes, especially these early developmental genes like hox that will have far-reaching consequences. when you modify the same genes in the same way in the entire human population, you also lose genetic diversity, which is in and of itself a huge problem. so yes. it is morally unethical to modify our children's early development genes because we have no way of knowing the ultimate consequences of these actions. while we may help their intelligence or athleticism, we could be ruining their lives with another unforeseen phenotypic effect. it is also morally unethical to purposely lower the genetic diversity of our population in the name of increased attractiveness and things like that. lowering our diversity affects the human species as a whole and makes us less fit for the world we live in. tl;dr: the genes involved in intelligence, athleticism, and attractiveness are early development genes that would have far-reaching consequences if we were to mutate them. furthermore, lowering genetic diversity by giving everyone the same genes could potentially fuck up our ability to evolve as a species. this kills the humans.",cqocbaf,584.4309242300806,1,1429983748,380,22,10441,0,51.965,846.0,1366.0,47.0,1,0.14893617021276595,0.0425531914893617,0.0851063829787234,0.1276595744680851,0.0,0.0425531914893617,0.0,0.0425531914893617,0.0,0.0,0.0425531914893617,0.0,0.0851063829787234,0.0,0.6170212765957447,0.08972799543451718,0.19858156028368795,0.0,0,0.0,850,72.52,90.01,7.77,17.25,18.09,22.12,80.47,50.82,13.29,6.82,0.24,3.76,2.12,0.00,0.71,6.47,7.41,13.41,6.47,4.35,8.00,0.82,13.41,3.88,1.88,1.18,0.71,2.59,4.59,2.00,2.59,0.12,0.24,0.94,10.47,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,12.24,0.82,3.18,2.94,3.41,1.65,2.35,0.47,0.35,0.12,0.00,4.00,3.18,0.82,0.12,0.12,10.59,4.00,1.41,2.71,1.06,1.76,0.59,10.24,1.65,12.00,2.12,7.41,2.59,1.06,0.82,0.00,0.24,0.00,0.35,0.35,0.12,0.00,0.12,0.12,0.00,12.59,5.18,3.65,0.24,0.12,0.24,0.12,0.35,0.47,0.71,1.18,0.35
t3_3fkcij,"hi, op. my answer might seem a bit amateurish as i have only lurked here so far, so i hope that rather than provide a conclusion, i can offer my opinion to further a healthy discussion. now, i personally use metacritic when i decide on films and i consider it better for me personally for reasons similar to the ones you have outlined, but i think it is clear that that's not what you are saying. you are saying that the rottentomatoes score is, for a person of the general public, a typical moviegoer, less pragmatic than a metacritic score. i do not think this is true. consider a score that is right in the middle. metacritic says that this means that the film has had ""mixed or average reviews."" note that those are two different things. mixed is not equivalent to average, and metacritic has no way of distinguishing simply based on the score. so, metacritic offers, in its rating system, the reviews below aside, no way to determine from the score whether something is polarizing or simply bland. rottentomatoes does offer this. if something is bland, it will likely simply get a low score, whereas if something is polarizing, it will get a medium score. and it is not simply with yellow scores. if you move up a bit, you can have a film with a somewhat high score, like say, 75 on metacritic. this could still be somewhat polarizing, with a lot of people saying it is bland, a few less saying it is very good, and even less saying it is horrible. or maybe everyone thinks it is good/okay. whereas metacritic determines how good a film is, rottentomatoes measures how polarizing a film is, or how massive of an audience it is catered to. the typical filmgoer will want to see a film that they think they will like. ___ let's imagine, for a bit, a hypothetical filmgoer who uses only rottentomatoes scores and one who uses only metacritic scores. if they watched a thousand movies based on scores that were 75 or above for both, the rottentomatoes person can be predicted to have liked 75 percent of the films or more. since a metacritic score can be 75 percent even if 60 percent of people thought it was a bland film, there is a plausible likelihood that our metacritic person would like only 40 percent of the films. so, you are more likely to like a film with a high rottentomatoes score than you are to like a film with a high metacritic score, even if you would like a film with a high metacritic score more. i do not expect this to be a clear explanation of my analysis, so please reply and ask as many questions as you need until you understand.",ctpeutw,1270.1052174353188,1,1438592278,15,6,1057,0,59.18050536420104,462.0,695.0,23.0,11,0.0,0.0,0.13043478260869565,0.30434782608695654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.043478260869565216,0.0,0.0,0.5217391304347826,0.13128361537452446,0.16666666666666666,0.0,0,0.0,468,48.74,53.42,21.37,80.10,20.35,18.80,89.96,55.98,13.89,5.98,2.78,0.43,2.14,0.00,0.64,7.91,9.19,9.83,10.90,6.20,7.48,1.50,18.16,7.91,4.06,1.71,1.92,4.49,3.85,3.42,0.43,0.21,0.00,0.21,8.33,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,16.88,4.27,2.14,2.99,5.77,0.85,5.77,2.56,1.07,1.50,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,7.48,0.64,0.21,2.14,4.70,0.00,1.07,14.96,1.71,6.41,0.21,5.13,1.07,0.85,3.42,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.43,0.00,0.21,0.21,0.00,0.00,13.25,4.91,6.62,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.43,0.43,0.00,0.85

t3_3k16tq,"the main reason given for taxing capital gains at a lower rate than income is that taxes on capital gains discourage people from selling assets, and high capital gains taxes result in an inefficient distribution of resources. say, for instance, that i own a small apartment building which i manage myself. as i get older, i am no longer capable of doing the management work on my own. if there were no tax, i would just sell the building to someone else, take the money and invest it in something that does not require active intervention like stocks. but if there is a high capital gains tax, it means that i would pay a large chunk of my gains in taxes, and thus i would be unlikely to sell the building, and thus i continue owning it, even though that's not the most economically efficient result. essentially it makes capital markets more sclerotic since the higher cap gains taxes are, the less people who own assets want to sell them. i will also point out that in the us at least, cap gains taxes are progressive. on short term capital gains, you pay your income tax rate. on long term capital gains, you pay 0% if you are in the 10 or 15% bracket, and 15% if you are in the 25% or higher bracket.",cutxh73,125.57919659834958,1,1441675920,18,5,564,0,62.045707070707095,220.0,312.0,9.0,141,0.1111111111111111,0.2222222222222222,0.2222222222222222,0.4444444444444444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.2222222222222223,0.22512626262626262,0.23636363636363636,0.0,0,0.0,225,63.81,32.84,52.22,19.16,25.00,14.67,84.89,51.11,14.67,8.44,5.33,0.44,2.22,0.00,0.44,6.22,7.11,11.56,7.11,4.00,6.67,1.78,12.00,7.56,5.33,0.89,2.22,1.78,1.33,0.44,0.89,0.00,0.00,0.89,5.33,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,12.44,0.89,3.11,3.56,4.44,0.00,5.33,0.44,0.00,0.44,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,10.67,0.44,5.33,4.00,4.89,0.00,0.89,9.33,0.44,13.33,0.00,10.67,2.67,10.22,0.00,0.44,10.22,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,12.89,4.00,6.67,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.44,0.00,1.78

t3_3ggp32,"i think its important to remember when reviewing history, that we not use modern notions of morality and hindsight to judge the actions of those in the past without understanding the context those decisions were made, which includes the morals and norms of the day, and the physical evidence they had available. every time the atomic bombs are mentioned, it seems like people keep bringing up the same arguments about how the atomic bombs were unnecessary. about how these were intended to kill civilians and were unnecessary since japan was going to surrender anyways. none of these, however, take into account what the decision makers had to deal with at the time, nor do they take into account the facts about japan's situation at the time. the whole talk about how the bombs were unnecessary and that japan was seeking to surrender forgets that japan didn't surrender despite given multiple chances. on july 26th, the allies in europe already issued the potsdam declaration, demanding japan's immediate and unconditional surrender - something the allies wanted to ensure they could never have a repeat of germany's rise after wwi which caused wwii. two of the points here: >point 10: we do not intend that the japanese shall be enslaved as a race or destroyed as a nation, but stern justice shall be meted out to all war criminals, including those who have visited cruelties upon our prisoners. the japanese government shall remove all obstacles to the revival and strengthening of democratic tendencies among the japanese people. freedom of speech, of religion, and of thought, as well as respect for the fundamental human rights shall be established. > >point 13: we call upon the government of japan to proclaim now the unconditional surrender of all japanese armed forces, and to provide proper and adequate assurances of their good faith in such action. the alternative for japan is prompt and utter destruction. not only did the japanese refuse this unconditional surrender, but japan thought it could broker a peace with the us through the soviet union which was already preparing its invasion of japan, to honor its agreement to declare war on japan within 100 days of its victory over germany. in addition, the power struggle in japan's government means that civilian government overtures to the americans held little weight. the japanese military government was the de facto power in japan and often overruled the civilian government. furthermore, the civilian government simply was not trusted by the us or any allied nations. the americans remembered that on the afternoon of december 7, japanese diplomat kurusu delivered japan's reply closing with the statement that ""the immutable policy of japan is to promote world peace."" he didn't know, due to the lag in communications, that at that moment, the bombing of pearl harbor had already commenced. what diplomatic integrity did japan have in the eyes of the nations they had attacked at that point? aerial and naval reconnaissance of the japanese home islands showed that the japanese were digging in and preparing for an invasion. these diplomatic overtures were often seen as just stall tactics in order to better fortify the japanese home islands to make an invasion less appealing, and thus give better terms for a brokered peace, which was the last thing the allies wanted. in fact, the allies knew that japan had tried that strategy before ? the whole point of the attack on pearl harbor was to buy time for the japanese to implement their defenses in the pacific in the hopes that it would make an american counter-offensive unpalatable. speaking of an invasion, operation downfall, the invasion of japan, was planned to commence in less than 100 days. the pre-invasion aerial and naval bombardment was scheduled for late october, and operation olympic, the invasion of kyushu was set for x-day, november 1st. the estimates for the death toll of an invasion of japan were tremendous. this is not some post-war revisionist estimates either - the military had estimated casualties based on the ever-rising death toll as the us got closer to the japanese home islands. on iwo jima, for instance, only 216 of the 21,000 japanese defenders surrendered. the us suffered over 6,700 killed and another 20,000 wounded in 35 days of fighting for *8 square miles* of island. okinawa was even more horrendous - over 12,000 americans were killed, another 55,000 wounded, and 38 ships lost in just 88 days of fighting. the japanese suffered even more - over 77,000 killed with another 100,000+ civilians killed on those islands. that?s estimated to be a third of the civilian population of okinawa. now extrapolate that kyushu, with its much higher population and highly populated cities (urban combat is notoriously deadly - over 200,000 were killed in 16 days in the battle of berlin), and any estimate is going to start in the hundreds of thousands killed. the alternative to an invasion, of course, was to blockade japan and starve its people to death. this would take time - and would ultimately have killed even more japanese than the bombings would have, as history?s famines have shown time and again. famine isn?t just discriminate ? it disproportionately targets the weak, elderly, and young who would die first. likewise, with food rations given to soldiers as a priority, civilians would have been disproportionately affected even further. thus, the atomic bombs were to be part of the series of aerial bombardment raids designed to cripple japan's ability to fight and hopefully force a surrender before the invasion was necessary. the us had already done firebombing, such as the raid over tokyo which killed more people than the atomic bombs did, as part of this same strategic bombing campaign. the atomic bombs were thus viewed as a new and more efficient way to carry out the campaign. keep in mind that all the negative focus on nuclear weapons of today is borne entirely out of our experience with nuclear weapons from these bombings and from the decades of the cold war. the very concept of nuclear weapons being unfathomable to use in war didn?t exist in 1945, and one could argue, largely came about precisely because these weapons were used. and for all the people that say the us wanted to kill indiscriminately, the fact is, the us dropped leaflets on over 30 cities in japan in the weeks and months before the atomic bombings, warning japanese civilians to evacuate their cities. they even very specifically mention that they are not targeting civilians, but the installations and workshops and factories of war. the japanese text on the reverse side of one of the leaflets dropped carried the following warning: > ?read this carefully as it may save your life or the life of a relative or friend. in the next few days, some or all of the cities named on the reverse side will be destroyed by american bombs. these cities contain military installations and workshops or factories which produce military goods. we are determined to destroy all of the tools of the military clique which they are using to prolong this useless war. > >but, unfortunately, bombs have no eyes. so, in accordance with america's humanitarian policies, the american air force, which does not wish to injure innocent people, now gives you warning to evacuate the cities named and save your lives. america is not fighting the japanese people but is fighting the military clique which has enslaved the japanese people. the peace which america will bring will free the people from the oppression of the military clique and mean the emergence of a new and better japan. > >you can restore peace by demanding new and good leaders who will end the war. we cannot promise that only these cities will be among those attacked but some or all of them will be, so heed this warning and evacuate these cities immediately.? chilling to read those words, even today. the bombing of hiroshima, however, was met with silence from the japanese. as thus, the us proceeded again with the bombing of nagasaki. why a second one? simply because that was part of the strategy laid out to get japan to surrender - the us would use atomic bombs as they were manufactured and became available. keep in mind that during this time, the us could not mass-produce atomic weapons like it ended up being capable of doing in the cold war. the centrifuges simply weren't up to the quality and ability of years later, and so early on, they were only able to manufacture one or two bombs a month. nagasaki was the second and last of the bombs available ? the next one wouldn?t be ready for use for more another week with planners estimating the us having only 7 total available by the time of x-day. thus it was not about dropping a second bomb to be punitive ? it was dropped because a second one was available. in other words, the plan was to eventually use the bombs continually until japan surrendered or the invasion began in which case the bombs would then continue to fall in direct support of the troops until japanese capitulation. and still, even with the soviet entry into the war against japan, there was silence and even resistance to surrender. an attempted coup against the japanese emperor was tried but failed, and the emperor made his famous broadcast to the japanese people declaring his decision to surrender. in it, he very specifically mentions the atomic bombs, to which i conclude: >moreover, the enemy has begun to employ a new and most cruel bomb, the power of which to do damage is, indeed, incalculable, taking the toll of many innocent lives. should we continue to fight, not only would it result in an ultimate collapse and obliteration of the japanese nation, but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization.",cty35gw,2690.415041834774,1,1439227671,102,15,9976,0,43.16691919191922,1620.0,2657.0,66.0,3,0.15151515151515152,0.07575757575757576,0.18181818181818182,0.06060606060606061,0.0,0.0,0.030303030303030304,0.07575757575757576,0.0,0.015151515151515152,0.015151515151515152,0.015151515151515152,0.07575757575757576,0.0,0.696969696969697,0.08482876382148463,0.2222222222222222,0.0,0,0.0,1662,92.29,59.51,14.84,6.41,25.18,23.77,79.72,50.06,7.70,2.53,0.12,1.14,0.24,0.24,0.78,5.17,10.17,15.76,7.34,4.39,5.78,1.26,12.27,4.03,2.53,1.38,2.77,2.53,5.48,1.87,3.61,0.06,2.77,0.30,5.17,0.00,0.24,0.00,0.24,9.57,1.20,2.23,1.26,1.32,1.50,2.77,0.84,0.30,0.30,0.18,0.96,0.18,0.66,0.00,0.18,10.11,1.87,1.50,6.14,0.78,0.48,5.42,5.05,1.20,12.15,1.08,5.66,5.29,2.11,0.06,0.18,0.36,0.24,1.50,0.18,0.00,0.00,0.06,0.06,0.06,12.09,3.85,5.42,0.30,0.00,0.12,0.00,0.84,0.12,0.60,0.12,0.72

t3_37i8f6,"i am a little late to the party, but want to present the issue a little differently, so here goes: as the issue involves two competing rights, the legal system in deciding this issue needs to apply an oliver wendell holmes-style balancing test. the two competing rights are: 1. the right of the child to receive financial support from his/her parents vs. 2. the right of the father to decline financial support to a child he did not consent to father i specifically say financial support, not fatherhood, because courts do not (and cannot) force a father to be ""involved"" in a child's life; they can't force the guy to love the kid. the courts can compel the father to pay money, though; the issue is a financial one. since the two rights stated above cannot co-exist, the state is forced into a decision because whether the state acts or not, it will be promoting one party's rights over the other. 1. if the state *acts*, and compels the father to pay support, it is promoting the rights of the child over the rights of the father, vs. 2. if the state *does not act*, and allows the father to withdraw support, it promotes the rights of the father over the rights of the child. thus, the balancing test: forced into a decision between promoting one party's rights over the other, the state balances the benefits and detriments of deciding in one party's favor. this issue is usually presented as the rights of the child outweighing the rights of the father. i actually look at it from sort of the opposite way- it is not that the rights of the father are less that the rights of the child, its that **the father is better able to bear the burden of having his rights deprived than the child is**. thus, the courts decide in the child's favor. example of what i mean: say a father earns $3000 per month, and his hypothetical child support payments are $500 per month- a huge chunk of his income. if the state acts and compels the father to pay the child support, it is significantly burdening the father by depriving him of 1/6 of his income. *however* (and it sounds shitty to say, but) the father also has the *ability* to recoup the $500. the father can aim for a promotion and increase his salary, or take a second job. the father has the ability, in theory, to recoup the money the state has deprived of him. the child, on the other hand, has no such ability. children cannot work, so if the child loses out on the $500, that $500 is gone. thus, the father, through his theoretical ability to earn more money, is better able to bear the burden of being deprived of his rights, and the courts rule in the child's favor. important notes!: 1. i understand how shitty it is to say ""oh, the father can just take a second job."" this is *not* an ideal solution to the issue; it is a balancing test choosing between the lesser of two evils, the evils being depriving one party or the other of their rights. 2. as such, a better solution is a stronger social safety net. in an ideal world, a single mother would receive enough support from the government to negate the impact of losing the father's financial support. if this were the case, i could see the argument that it shifts the balancing test in the father's favor. as it is, however, with so many single mothers raising their children in poverty, there is clearly not a strong enough social safety not, and so the balancing test is applied as is. 3. the *best* solution, however, is to prevent the situation from happening in the first place. this means (a) comprehensive sex education in schools and (b) widespread access to affordable (or better, free) contraception. in colorado, a program that gave free iuds to low-income women dropped the teen-pregnancy rate and abortion rate by nearly half each. this also, undoubtedly, had the effect of forcing fewer fathers to pay child support to kids they didn't want.",crn97hc,1346.9697357343164,1,1432810861,1974,33,22456,0,65.28115604655753,685.0,994.0,37.0,4,0.05405405405405406,0.08108108108108109,0.16216216216216217,0.1891891891891892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02702702702702703,0.02702702702702703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02702702702702703,0.0,0.5675675675675675,0.07695665354979082,0.1897810218978102,0.0,0,0.0,704,95.31,61.74,5.17,79.99,20.71,16.19,85.23,51.28,7.24,3.12,0.85,0.00,0.00,1.70,0.57,4.12,15.48,13.07,6.68,3.41,5.97,2.27,11.08,3.27,2.13,0.43,4.12,0.99,6.96,4.97,1.99,0.00,0.43,1.14,11.79,3.84,0.14,0.57,4.97,11.79,1.99,2.70,1.70,2.13,0.43,5.40,1.28,0.43,0.71,0.14,1.14,0.43,0.43,0.43,0.00,11.79,1.28,4.12,5.82,2.27,0.71,0.85,9.66,0.14,6.39,0.71,4.55,1.42,5.26,0.71,0.00,2.98,0.00,0.00,0.57,0.28,0.14,0.00,0.14,0.00,20.45,5.11,6.53,0.71,0.43,0.00,0.14,0.85,0.57,1.42,1.42,3.27
t3_35peeu,"a lot of your arguments boil down to opinions, which you can't really change by stating facts. you may not think chrome looks good, but others would say that it does. it really comes down to personal taste. you also have to give chrome a lot of credit for pushing the state-of-the-art in web and web browser development. before chrome came out in 2008, the web was an incredibly difficult platform to develop on. a majority of the web's users used various forms of internet explorer, with a much smaller population using firefox. and even as far as browser design was considered, it was all toolbars, all the time (modeled after ie6). chrome really shook up browser design, in a very big way. with tabs in the window header, people had a lot more vertical viewing room, which made browsing the web better. along with browsing, having better support for new html, css, and javascript features allowed developers to build beautiful, performant websites without using external plugins (like flash and java). this gave way to responsive web design, allowing pages to look good no matter what device the user is browsing with. finally, on the subject of memory use, chrome is a hog for a reason: security. chrome was the first browser to have tab sandboxing, which means that each browser tab spawns its own operating system process. should the tab crash for some reason (flash fails to load, page can't be reached on the server, etc), it will not bring down the entire browser. also, code running in one tab can't access the data in another tab; they are accessing entirely different sections of memory. that all comes at a cost, however: with more tabs open and more processes running, more memory is being used. that's less of a concern now since users are commonly using machines with 4+ gb of ram, but it can still bog down the rest of the machine since the os has to page memory in and out of disk swap (but now i am getting far too technical). extensions as well also operate in their own process, so the more extensions you have installed, the more memory you are using. as i said in the first paragraph, i do not expect this explanation will change your mind. however, it is important to know the design decisions the chrome dev team made, and how it impacted the rest of the web. most other browsers look/operate like chrome because chrome pioneered a far superior way of doing things, and other browser vendors followed suit. i have only scratched the surface of what chrome has done (their v8 javascript vm, webrtc, spdy/http 2.0, rapid development cycle, webm, etc etc etc). point being, chrome is very much on the forefront of web and browser development. google employs a lot of brilliant people to work on this product, and it shows. just because the browser's design has stabilized is not a sign that it is slowing down; rather it is a sign that others are catching up.",cr6ssh1,1109.0658236091576,1,1431481853,389,53,43388,0,63.69260565521435,506.0,738.0,26.0,2,0.11538461538461539,0.0,0.2692307692307692,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.423076923076923,0.0908258408258408,0.26877470355731226,0.0,0,0.0,514,86.50,43.04,42.36,55.09,20.56,19.46,73.93,48.05,8.75,2.72,0.78,0.00,1.36,0.00,0.58,6.03,8.17,14.59,7.78,4.47,5.06,1.75,14.20,5.64,4.09,1.17,1.17,4.67,3.31,2.33,0.78,0.19,0.19,0.19,3.70,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,13.81,2.72,4.09,0.78,1.36,1.17,4.28,1.95,1.17,0.39,0.19,0.97,0.00,0.58,0.00,0.19,5.45,0.19,1.36,2.72,1.36,0.78,2.92,8.75,0.78,12.84,2.72,7.59,2.72,2.72,0.78,0.39,0.39,0.00,0.00,0.19,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.19,0.00,17.12,4.86,7.20,0.39,0.39,0.00,0.00,0.58,0.00,1.17,1.95,0.58

t3_2w4e2u,"my law & economics class recently debated prostitution, and we read a couple papers. let me see if i can make a solid argument based on that: prostitution is not an object that you buy like a toy, it is a service. when you pay for a service, you are paying for someone to do something, whereas when you buy an object, you are paying for a physical good that has been produced or gathered by someone. this distinction is important; it helps to think of prostitutes not as prostitutes, but individuals who sell prostitution as a service, hence, can really sell any other skill as a service if they so choose. hence, we ask the question: if a person who believes they can market their sexual skills in exchange for money chooses to do so in a fashion independent of desperation or coercion, should they be allowed? in other words, excluding trafficking victims and so-called 'street walkers' who are in poor socioeconomic status, should people be allowed to sell sex for money? i would argue that a person who makes a rational decision on their own accord should in fact be allowed to do so. such a system ought to ensure that: * trafficking is tackled as its own separate issue * sex workers are given a safe working environment, regulated according to health and safety rules like any other business * sex workers have rapid access to necessary health, safety, and police services to report crimes of sexual assault * individuals buying services from prostitutes fully understand the liabilities, and risks present the best way to organize such a system would be to allow prostitutes to receive registration and employment through brothels. brothels could provide centres for which prostitutes could get medical attention, counselling, career advice (if they ever wish to leave the trade), etc, and when placed in commercial areas, may actually drive business the same way that bars and strip joints have been shown to do in the past. this, combined with multi-lingual counsellors checking in with *every* employed prostitute, would ensure that trafficking was at the very least reduced, and that prostitutes are fully informed of their rights. i believe that such a system is possible, and here is why i think it would be better than simply outlawing prostitution: first, prostitution is going to happen anyway. ignoring prostitution does not make it go away, and while many countries have been successful at stopping it almost completely in its tracks (sweden, norway, iceland et al), the few people who are still involved in the system (due to ever-existing demand) are at incredibly high risk of rape, assault, and even murder. i think this can be overcome by making it known that prostitutes are respected and have the help they need, when they need it. second, legalization combined with harsh anti-trafficking measures will help reduce trafficking instances. studies have shown that legalization and liberalization of prostitution does, in fact, increase the incidence of trafficking to those countries when they are wealthy. however, many of these countries simply legalize prostitution and pay very little heed to combatting trafficking and black market prostitution in general, partly because of a mere failure to think of the problem, and partly because of the structures of legalization involved. having support staff on hand will help victims of trafficking seek help, will inform them of their right to leave sex work, and may even provide intel on trafficking routes and leaders. third, people who are buying prostitutes are facing a much different market. they can be sure that the people they are paying for to have sex are clean, not trafficked, and are in the sellers market because they want to be. while prostitution policy should definitely focus on keeping workers themselves safe and in good hands, it does not hurt that such a system would also positively affect buyers, and make them feel better about the transaction they enter in to with a prostitute. --- so, to summarize, i think that legalization, combined with an effective structure, harsh anti-trafficking measures, and a prostitute-focused mission to improve their lives is better than merely ignoring the problem, or even trying to sweep it away. this, of course, depends on whether or not you see prostitution as a social problem or a legitimate job, but i think that the fact still stands that prostitution will still happen whether or not you think it is a bad thing, so making them safer seems, honestly, like the best position to take.",conpgz6,973.3487639562085,1,1424139421,84,19,15836,0,36.17338967107659,749.0,1205.0,22.0,4,0.045454545454545456,0.09090909090909091,0.2727272727272727,0.22727272727272727,0.0,0.0,0.045454545454545456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045454545454545456,0.09090909090909091,0.045454545454545456,0.8636363636363635,0.12263021370164226,0.2576769025367156,0.0,0,0.0,756,60.07,63.97,16.18,25.77,34.36,23.41,89.42,51.98,11.38,5.03,1.19,0.26,0.93,0.00,2.65,6.35,6.08,12.70,9.79,5.56,8.07,0.93,16.53,3.84,2.65,1.98,0.40,1.46,6.08,3.04,3.04,0.40,0.79,0.26,8.99,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,16.01,3.04,3.04,3.17,3.31,1.59,4.50,1.19,0.40,0.00,0.79,5.29,0.40,0.66,4.10,0.13,8.99,1.19,2.51,4.23,1.59,1.85,1.32,12.57,1.06,9.52,1.19,5.69,2.78,7.28,0.26,0.13,3.70,0.00,0.13,0.13,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.13,14.42,2.65,7.67,0.53,0.13,0.26,0.00,1.19,0.00,0.26,0.79,0.93

t3_3ehqjy,"well, depends on what you mean. i do not think the day to day life would be miserable at all. sure, there may be an initial workload shock for some but that's adult life. since you do not seem to be including the benefits of graduating from one of these schools in your definition of ""happiness"", then the high tuition rates should not affect your definition of ""happiness"" either. you assume that, regardless of financial input/output, the daily life of an ivy league student is not enjoyable. also, what exactly are you comparing it to? i am sure the students experience plenty of miserable days but plenty of good ones as well. other students may just be generally miserable and going to one of those colleges just exacerbates their misery. others probably just do their best to persevere. others yet may be completely within their element. i guess i am saying that much of your opinion may come from your personality. ivy league schools definitely are not for everyone. i should add: not all ivy league schools are created equal. big difference between harvard and, say, brown. so this question may also apply to a student at stanford or duke. college is generally pretty tough regardless. my personal experience didn't involve ivy league schools, and it would be cool to have some insight from someone who has. i went through high school on cruise control, so when i got to college, my attitude just didn't cut it. i was caught off guard by how hard things were and how much effort everything took. i remember being in a hard calculus class and just not studying, my attitude was that far gone. eventually dropped out, partially for financial reasons but also because my grades weren't great. now, more adjusted to the adult world and more ambitious, organized, and goal oriented, i do not have as much apathy for putting out effort in an attempt to get ahead. so in a span of just three years i have gone from someone who would agree with you to someone who is motivated to get out of a dead end job and back into school. i work harder now than i ever did in college and i think the idea of getting into a field i am excited about would make me plenty happy. just an anecdote but, yeah, i think it is different for everyone.",ctf4g16,524.8378540533314,1,1437780961,18,7,4328,0,65.71827761194031,402.0,593.0,25.0,1,0.12,0.0,0.2,0.08,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04,0.08,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04,0.0,0.56,0.06352813852813853,0.25870646766169153,0.0,0,0.0,403,41.33,32.76,71.00,76.27,16.12,20.60,94.29,57.82,14.64,8.19,5.21,0.00,2.23,0.00,0.74,6.45,3.97,15.14,10.92,7.69,6.70,2.73,16.87,7.20,2.98,1.99,0.74,3.72,6.70,4.47,1.74,0.99,0.00,0.99,7.20,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.25,20.35,3.47,2.73,1.99,5.21,2.73,5.96,2.23,0.25,0.50,0.99,0.74,0.00,0.74,0.00,0.00,8.19,0.99,2.48,2.48,2.98,0.25,3.97,10.17,2.23,11.66,1.99,5.71,4.22,7.44,0.25,0.00,0.74,0.00,0.25,1.24,0.00,0.00,0.74,0.50,0.00,13.40,5.96,4.71,0.25,0.00,0.25,0.00,0.00,0.99,0.99,0.00,0.25

t3_3dll0j,">dylann had a single pistol and reloaded on five separate occasions (article here). does not anyone find it hard to understand the fact that he was able to shoot and kill so many fully grown adult individuals without people either scattering or taking action in a room with at least 2+ exits? >if he had an automatic rifle, it would be easier to understand. but a pistol that has to fire single shots? five reloads? i am not a gun expert, so hoping that someone with more experience could chime in here. a couple of things: first and foremost, the sorts of rifles that people like to typify as ""automatic"" that are used in mass shootings are not actually automatic. seriously, they aren't. automatic fire is defined as more than 1 bullet leaving the firearm when the trigger is pressed down, and bullets not leaving the firearm when the trigger is up; most of these rifles are ""semi-automatic"" in that when the trigger is pressed, one bullet leaves the chamber and another cartridge is loaded into the chamber, but you can't hold the trigger down to spray out bullets; 1 and only 1 bullet leaves for each trigger pull in a semi-automatic rifle. actual automatic fire weapons are legal for civilians only in very limited number and circumstances, and prices start at about $20,000 for a vietnam-era m-16 with full auto capability. as such, they are relegated to expensive range toys, and typically mass murderers are not affluent enough to get one. the pistol he used was a glock 41, which has a 13 round magazine. anecdotally, a trained shooter could go through a magazine that size in a second or two with a semi-automatic pistol (again, the same mechanism used by the ar-15). now, 5 reloads means that he shot, at most, ~70 rounds in about 30 seconds to 1 minute, accounting for reload time. that model of glock is made for competition shooting, and the design is specifically done to compensate more for muzzle rise with a longer barrel (there are physics at work that i am not qualified to explain in-depth, but the basic idea is that the more weight is in front of your hand, the easier it is to control recoil, which is why i actually recommend that people who are less experienced shoot full-framed metal pistols instead of tiny snub-nose .38 revolvers that people typically get for their girlfriends, but i digress) as for why people didn't leave, well, panic does weird things to you, and all i can say to that is that people honestly and truly do not know what they will do in a life-or-death situation until they are in the middle of one. however, i would wager that most people do not go to church expecting to get shot at, and so the element of surprise counts for a lot. i think hollywood has distorted our ideas of shootings with long drawn-out action scenes, and for the most part it is like that when you are there, because adrenaline has a weird time dilation effect where those few seconds seem like the longest hour of your life, but it is really over comparatively quickly. >dylann was wearing bulky body armor from the moment he walked into the church. wouldn't someone be a little bit suspicious about a strange white kid that no one's ever seen before wearing bulky body armor at your church group?

t3_3ecjmj,"1. pronunciation: yeah you can talk about the letters themselves, but what about when you have to use them? x is a harsh sound, demanding it is attention and rarely allowing for subtlety. y's only whiny in one of its usages. since it has several different sounds it can be used in a number of different ways, often to accentuate the sounds of other letters. 2. exclusivity: x is a much more difficult letter to use. it is less common because the words it are used in are usually fairly specialized. yes, y takes a lot of credit for being in the ""-ly"" alliance, but i want to see you go a day without using y. i can go a day without using x 3. consistency. x is always a consonant to its detriment. y is the only letter that's both a consonant and a vowel, allowing it to be applied to a significantly greater number of contexts. it is useful. x has to sit out and wait on its turn while y is readily available when i needs to take a breather. 4. scrabble. x has caused more scrabble fights than y ever will, and as someone else has said, it is twice as hard to find a use for the letter 5. math. yes, x is always the first variable, but it is not like y is that far behind. and x may be the consistent axis, but the variable y axis is where the really interesting stuff comes up. in a simple graph relating distance over time, yeah the time is important, but we are really interested in how far the object traveled, which is the value on the y axis. 6. appearance. ok, tbh, i agree with you here 7. sex. i got nothing here. point for x 8. history. i did a quick wikipedia search on the presidents. 12 of them had y in their names, including john quincy adams, ulysses grant, and harry truman. the only president with x in his name is nixon. 9. versatility in other areas. i will grant that we use x significantly more outside of writing, but i will point out that these are generally negative connotations and that y's extreme versatility as a letter likely outweighs x's advantage here. 10. apparently y was not an original roman numeral, so point to x. 11. no one has ever been born or fallen in love in a state beginning with the letter x either. edit: yeah i forgot about texas and new mexico too 12. if we are talking about unknown items, we can also say ""x is worse than y"" haha this was fun :) edit: letter count: use ctrl+f to see the massive discrepancy between x usage and y usage in this thread alone.",ctdmtn2,2441.148376872825,1,1437679525,273,44,1929,0,74.45488053097347,452.0,646.0,40.0,1,0.025,0.0,0.15,0.1,0.0,0.0,0.025,0.025,0.05,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.025,0.0,0.4000000000000001,0.03109326570865032,0.2411504424778761,0.0,0,0.0,467,72.32,48.29,40.03,66.31,11.39,15.42,78.37,50.54,10.28,4.71,1.93,0.86,0.86,0.21,0.86,5.57,7.49,13.28,9.85,5.57,5.78,1.50,15.63,5.78,3.21,1.28,3.64,1.93,4.28,3.21,1.07,0.00,0.21,0.21,6.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.21,12.63,0.64,3.21,0.64,3.00,1.07,4.71,2.36,0.86,1.07,0.43,0.64,0.21,0.00,0.21,0.00,4.71,1.28,0.43,1.93,0.86,0.43,2.78,12.21,0.86,13.06,1.28,6.85,4.71,1.50,0.86,0.00,0.21,0.00,0.00,2.14,0.00,0.64,1.50,0.00,0.00,16.70,8.57,4.71,1.07,0.00,0.21,0.00,0.21,0.86,0.86,0.00,0.21
t3_3ecjmj,"1) x may sound cooler, but the sound is not exclusive. it can be similarly made with an -ecs or -ecks if you want. there is no way to reproduce the sound of y. 2) exclusivity does not mean something is better. x is certainly used less, which i would argue makes it a more useless letter. if you could have a key that opens 10 treasure chests, or a key that opens 20, which would you choose? certainly the more useful one. 3) x may always be a consonant, but it also does not always sound the same. sometimes it is an -ecs sound, sometimes it is a z sound. ""xylophone"" and ""for example"" 4) x is only worth so many points because of it is uselessness. it is like getting paid to take the worst player in sports. only q is more useless in scrabble, so much so that they had to add the u to it. 5) as others have said, x works for y. it is like the factory worker and the boss. who gets paid more? even so, eventually the greek letters beat all of them out. 6) y may be more unstable, but it can easily be pounded into the ground like a stake. the x is not as easy. or it could just stand there. i have never seen one fall over, so it must be quite talented at standing there. 7) the x in sex is great, i will admit that. however, you also need consent. without that y in yes, the x in sex is useless. 8) x is history, you are right. y is the future though. see terminator genysis. 9) i thought you wanted something consistent? now you are saying it is a good thing that x can be used in multiple ways, but it is bad for y to be able to be both a consonant and a vowel? this is hypocritical. 10) =y this one looks like a duck with its mouth open. it is cute. yours is going to starve because it can't eat, and is being mean and refusing to talk to anyone. 11) nobody has died in a state with an x because x is a communist letter. nobody wants it in their state name. it is unamerican. 12) it is wrong to claim that any unknown item is better than any other unknown item. y is being humble here, and x is being an asshole.",ctdn8gf,1797.5346560907542,1,1437680103,273,44,2507,0,86.87216827380146,398.0,513.0,37.0,5,0.08108108108108109,0.0,0.16216216216216217,0.1891891891891892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02702702702702703,0.02702702702702703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4864864864864865,0.018518518518518517,0.20351758793969849,0.0,0,0.0,412,35.43,47.09,6.47,38.73,11.14,11.41,82.77,55.58,13.59,3.88,0.97,0.00,2.18,0.00,0.73,9.71,7.28,9.47,14.56,4.85,7.04,2.43,20.87,5.58,4.61,0.73,4.13,3.40,5.10,2.91,2.18,0.00,0.49,0.97,5.58,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,14.56,1.21,1.70,2.67,4.37,1.70,4.85,2.91,0.73,1.94,0.24,1.70,0.73,0.00,0.49,0.49,5.58,0.24,1.46,2.18,1.94,0.73,2.43,16.26,1.94,7.52,0.49,4.61,2.43,0.97,0.49,0.00,0.97,0.00,0.24,0.73,0.24,0.24,0.24,0.00,0.00,18.45,8.01,4.37,0.00,0.00,0.97,0.00,0.73,0.97,0.24,2.91,0.24
t3_3ecjmj,"1, tonal fluidity. x has a harsher pronunciation, a quality not usually considered good. consider languages that have harsher tones, such as german and russian. conversely, languages with the more fluid tones that y has, such as french and italian, are considered more beautiful. 2, utility. the purpose of language, and its constituent letters, is to be used and to be useful. a letter that can be used more often is better than a letter that cannot. y is used in adverbs. it enables us to act with nuance. x is typically used to describe things that used to be (ex-girlfriend, for example), and keeps us locked in the past. 3, flexibility. while x must always be a consonant, y is able to flexibly switch between vowel and consonant. indeed, it is the only letter able to do so. this unique power really grants y super-letter status. perhaps it has other powers, such as flight, and shooting lasers out of its top two prongs. 4, scrabble. here is the thing about y: it is a get out of jail free card. let us say you are stuck and you just can't think of a word with the letters you have. instead of skipping a turn or taking whatever punishment scrabble has, if you have a y, you can just pop that onto the end of so many other words. sexy, smokey, many. the list goes on. you can't quite do that as well with x. sexx? smokex? manx? well, i guess manx works. but still. y is better at the job. 5, x in algebra. x is the first letter learned in algebra, sure. but this is because x is mysterious and untrustworthy. some days, x is 5. other days, x is 10. who are you, x?! and who are the members of your axis of evil?! 6, pleasing appearance. this is one of taste, so i do not think i can change your view on this. however, perhaps you would accept a different viewpoint. the y displays the pleasing triangle shape that women like to see in fit men. y has a strong chest and a thin waist. presumably, under a magnifying glass, we would be able to see y's six-pack abs. 7, all sex requires x. but not all sex is sexy sex. 8, x typically highlights the more violent aspects of our history. malcolm x, and american history x. x is mired in racism. y is typically present in the more fun parts of our culture and society. yoyo ma. yogi bear. yosemite sam. 9, you can use y on its own in a text for a word.

t3_37ofos,"like you have said in one of your replies, you are making a semantic argument, and there is nothing wrong with that! by your definition, you are correct, skinny shaming does not exist. if someone can only truly be ashamed of something that is considered by **most people** to be shameful, then you can't be ashamed of something that is generally considered to be desirable. what i am going to try to convince is that your definition of skinny-shaming is not useful and that you should change it so that skinny shaming does exist. say there is a girl who grows up on a fairly remote farm somewhere in america. she has no access to tv, the internet, or any other media, and she has no interaction with anyone outside her family. (and say it is a huge family, like 20 people. it will help my argument.) everyone else in her family is fat, but she is skinny, and they constantly berate her and abuse her for being skinny. naturally, she feels like her body type is abnormal and disgusting. from her perspective, being fat is completely normal, and she is the one disgusting, worthless outlier. but they are not really shaming her, right? she can't actually feel ashamed! people in other places think it is good to be skinny. so who cares that she has no conception of other people's cultural expectations and has no reason to think skinny body types are actually more acceptable? she has nothing to feel bad about! would you say that her family is not skinny shaming her? you could, but that would be silly. she does not know that she has supposed to feel good about being skinny. she feels just as bad as a fat person might feel anywhere else. and since her situation is completely analogous to what fat shaming would be anywhere else, skinny shaming would be a great term to use for this. the term skinny shaming is useful if you define it as anything that makes someone feel ashamed of being skinny. (and going along with that, you should define shame as any feeling of lack of self-worth or embarrassment, regardless of whether it is rational to feel that way.) what is important in the situation is not that someone should or should not feel bad about something, but that they do. if you define skinny shaming this way, you will have a new term with which you can identify a variety of situations, and you will have an easier time communicating with other people about those situations. and if you define skinny shaming your way, you will have a term that describes absolutely nothing, because like you said, it ""doesn't exist."" ^(and now that i am finished, let me just say how weird that felt to literally argue about semantics. it is such an abstract thing to think about. i like it!)",crojxtr,2348.9555054879634,1,1432883410,254,18,-15522,0,65.09252066115704,484.0,714.0,29.0,1,0.0,0.0,0.13793103448275862,0.2413793103448276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034482758620689655,0.0,0.0,0.06896551724137931,0.034482758620689655,0.0,0.5172413793103448,0.061352040816326545,0.1797520661157025,0.0,0,0.0,487,12.88,82.23,6.07,10.29,16.79,17.25,93.02,63.24,20.53,10.06,1.03,0.00,4.11,4.31,0.62,10.27,3.08,11.91,14.37,5.75,7.19,3.49,21.97,6.98,2.46,1.64,0.62,1.03,6.57,2.67,3.90,1.44,0.82,0.21,16.02,0.82,0.00,4.52,0.00,22.38,5.95,1.85,3.70,5.34,1.85,6.37,3.49,0.00,1.23,2.26,1.23,1.23,0.82,0.00,0.82,5.75,1.44,0.21,2.26,1.03,1.03,1.03,16.84,1.85,6.37,0.62,3.70,2.05,0.00,1.03,0.82,0.21,0.00,0.00,0.21,0.00,0.00,0.21,0.00,0.00,15.40,4.52,5.54,0.00,0.00,0.62,0.82,0.41,0.41,0.82,1.23,1.03

t3_381wn9,"1. a game of soccer can be drawn by any scoreline. 0-0, 1-1, 2-2 and so on. [in 2013 a premier league game ended 5-5](in no world could that game be seen as anything but entertaining. 2. for fans of a team, having them come back from a losing position to snatch a draw at the end of the game is super entertaining, and feels like a reward for their hard work and perseverance. if your suggestion that a draw be considered a loss were implemented, i believe it would in fact result in *less* entertaining games sometimes. if a team falls far enough behind that a draw is possible but a win unlikely, they no longer have anything to play for. 3. in many sports, a draw is worth significantly less than a win - to incentivise teams to try and get a victory rather than a draw. for example, in soccer again, a win gets you 3 points while a draw gets you 1. a loss gets 0 points. so a draw is already closer to a loss than a win. this can have real consequences. for example, in the [2008/09 premier league season](liverpool finished in second place despite having lost 2 games all season, compared to man utd, the champions, losing 4. the reason? they drew 11 games compared to man utd drawing 6. 4. in some competitions where a winner is forced through a tie-breaker, a team can essentially play for the tie breaker scenario, knowing they wouldn't win in a 'fair' match. for example, in the [2012 champions league final](the english team chelsea faced the german bayern munich. chelsea were considered the underdogs, but they played in a defensive style and took the game to a penalty shoot-out, which they won.",crrsmk6,242.79452120009722,1,1433193486,36,6,23331,0,69.47829856115109,278.0,405.0,20.0,2,0.05,0.0,0.2,0.1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15,0.0,0.0,0.05,0.0,0.55,0.060690187005976476,0.27697841726618705,0.0,0,0.0,305,96.86,68.85,19.03,87.56,14.52,15.74,79.34,46.23,6.23,3.61,0.33,0.00,0.98,0.00,2.30,2.62,12.46,14.10,6.56,2.62,4.59,0.98,12.13,5.25,3.61,0.66,7.87,1.97,8.20,5.90,2.30,0.00,0.00,1.97,8.52,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.66,10.49,1.97,1.31,1.97,3.28,0.66,3.28,0.98,0.33,0.00,0.66,0.33,0.33,0.00,0.00,0.00,15.41,5.25,8.85,3.93,4.92,1.97,3.28,7.21,0.00,12.13,0.66,7.87,3.93,2.95,7.21,0.00,0.33,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,20.00,6.56,5.90,0.00,0.00,0.33,0.00,2.30,0.00,0.98,0.98,2.95

t3_3k8c42,">3.) i will preorder whatever the fuck i want, and here is why. development does not start when the game goes on preorder. there is this notion that if you preorder a game, they say ""oh, pack it up boys. we have made our money, sell the game with half the levels missing."" no. that's not what happens. when a game goes on preorder, the vast, vast majority of what is going to be in the game is decided. the story, the mechanics, the physics, the maps, levels, everything. the time between preorder and release is usually for bug splitting and refining. most of the time, whatever bugs get through are things that will only happen less than 1% of the time, and it just never came up in testing. sometime people do a shitty job of that because of rushed schedules, which brings me to, the idea behind not preordering is that you do not know how good the game is going to be ahead of time. people that preordered arkham knight are a perfect example of this. the previous games were great, and ran decently enough, so people got complacent. turns out, the game was a bag of shit when it launched and only recently got patched. >why do we suddenly feel like dlc is the devil? if i was sold a complete game worth the money when i purchased it, then what is so wrong with paying for more content? now i will agree that day one dlc of maps and extra levels and shit is unacceptable. i do not think most people would disagree with you, and that's really what is being complained about. payday 2 has an unbelievable amount of dlc, some paid, some free, but the game constantly gets new characters, heists, weapons, skins, etc. people bitch about the price, but hey, that's what you pay for to keep development on a 2 year old game. the flip side is what happened with mass effect 2/3. huge, huge parts of the story were put in dlc, basically giving you an incomplete experience if you didn't own them. i do not mind having expansions or new weapons and shit, but putting large pieces of the overall canon in dlc is a bad practice. >our standards are getting too high. mgsv just came out, and that game is excellent for a variety of reasons. i have seen people saying they wouldn't recommend this game to anyone. want to know why? because there is data in the game suggesting that there might have been additional story content that does not exist. i just finished mgsv, so i can give some perspective. the 3rd chapter was obviously removed from the game. literally an entire story line didn't even get explored, with a character that is central to the other games. we know this content was supposed to exist, but doesn't, for one reason or another, because kojima released a dvd with the story boards and overall plot, even including unfinished cut scenes. the issue is that, fundamentally, it is an unfinished game. the gameplay is fantastic, and i dropped 50 hours into the game in a week. if i weren't so invested in the story, i would still probably be mad because the story line that was left off literally stemmed off of a huge event in the game that is never discussed again. people are allowed to complain about things they care about, and most of the complaints you have listed here are valid.",cuvjp7s,2884.969214669475,1,1441808748,160,30,-20270,0,74.26233334883938,581.0,801.0,37.0,7,0.02702702702702703,0.0,0.13513513513513514,0.21621621621621623,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02702702702702703,0.02702702702702703,0.0,0.0,0.05405405405405406,0.02702702702702703,0.0,0.5135135135135136,NaN,0.2547332185886403,0.0,0,0.0,588,55.08,62.04,50.59,6.69,15.89,16.67,87.93,54.93,11.90,5.10,2.38,0.85,1.19,0.00,0.68,6.80,9.01,11.05,11.05,6.80,6.46,2.55,18.54,3.57,1.53,2.89,1.70,2.72,4.76,1.53,3.23,0.00,1.53,0.17,11.05,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.34,12.93,2.21,2.38,1.53,3.57,1.36,4.08,0.85,0.17,0.34,0.17,0.85,0.68,0.00,0.17,0.00,8.16,4.25,0.51,1.53,1.53,0.34,4.42,12.07,1.53,13.95,2.55,6.12,5.27,2.04,3.57,0.00,2.21,0.17,0.00,1.53,1.02,0.00,0.17,0.17,0.00,16.50,5.78,7.48,0.00,0.00,0.51,0.00,0.00,0.34,1.36,0.17,0.85

t3_37p0d8,"this is very much like a career in acting. you could say: well only a lucky few get to perform in movies. but the truth is, luck often has very little to do with it. 1: you most certainly do not need to be an attractive person to get an audience. sure, it might help a bit, but there are plenty of examples which say otherwise. take for example boogie2988. he is a big overweight person with 2.5 million subscribers. he is a lot of things, but i do not think his viewerbase thinks he is attractive on the appearance side of things. 2: neither is it important to be famous from other media. sure it helps out greatly, but it is no more than a kickstart. the real reason for their career lies in something else, which i shal expend on in the final paragraphs. take for example again boogie2988, or as a fresh example lindsey stirling. lindsey stirling is a musician, who became famous through youtube. she made some excellent music, and gained a fair share of subscribers. she became famous because someone entered her in the king of the web contest, and she went from a youtube musician to someone touring all over the world. marketing and skill are key. 3: while let us players have an easier time, because half of the content is made for them, there are plenty of other examples of people who became big without let us plays. in the top 100 youtube subscriber list, there are plenty of examples. many music channel, or things like epic mealtime, prankvsprank or erb (epic rap battles). so let us start talking about what made them succesfull in the first place. there are 3 big things which in my opinion get you a career in youtube/streaming 1: skill. the same reason why professional sports is one of the most watched media. the ability to do what millions of others cannot. the reason why so many league of legend channels are so big, is because the game has a large playerbase, and those players love watching the absolute top. it may not always be able to achieve this for everyone, but let me say that the top 50 starcraft 2 players practise a lot. 2: following up on that is the most important section: dedication. starting a channel or stream takes a lot of time. the mistake many people make is that they stream for maximum 2 hours, finally have 3 viewers and stop streaming. people attract people, and even the bigger streamers don?t achieve their mx viewers until hours after starting. this also goes for youtube. if you can only post 1 quality video every 2 weeks, you channel is not interesting enough. the ability to be a consistant source of entertainment is important. lethalfrag is an example of someone who made it into streaming. he saved his money so he didnt need income for a year, and went all/out streaming. he started from nothing, but since he was entertaining and going the entire year, he achieved his goal, and could sustain himself. boogie2988 has been youtubing for over 9 years now, he never gave up on the early hurdles. 3: charismatic. just like acting you need some skills. give viewers a good reason to watch you over those other 200 channels. although not my taste, a channel like pewdiepie knows what fanbase he has, and how to entertain them. stand out from others. so to conclude. yes, making money (enough to sustain yourself) only happens to a few. but those are not the lucky few, those are the people with the dedication (mostly) and skill (secondary) to really go for it. it is a lot like acting. sure getting a real job is safer, but your work is more than just income. i rather be barely surviving doing the thing i love, than being filthy rich and doing what i hate for 9 hours a day.",crolte5,536.2449454142289,1,1432890043,29,8,2954,0,73.41087215320911,644.0,912.0,48.0,1,0.041666666666666664,0.020833333333333332,0.1875,0.16666666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.020833333333333332,0.0,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.0,0.020833333333333332,0.041666666666666664,0.020833333333333332,0.5625,0.0353934481594056,0.2204968944099379,0.0,0,0.0,665,68.29,60.68,16.63,87.58,14.15,19.10,85.86,53.53,13.23,6.62,1.20,0.45,1.35,2.71,0.90,6.62,8.12,12.78,8.72,4.81,6.02,1.95,15.34,5.41,3.46,1.95,3.46,4.06,4.81,4.21,0.60,0.00,0.45,0.00,9.47,0.00,0.00,0.60,2.26,15.49,1.65,2.71,1.20,4.06,2.11,5.41,2.71,1.35,1.20,0.00,0.75,0.00,0.15,0.00,0.45,9.32,1.50,2.86,3.61,2.41,0.30,2.41,10.83,0.45,10.83,1.05,5.41,4.21,2.86,3.61,0.00,0.90,0.00,0.15,0.30,0.00,0.00,0.15,0.15,0.00,14.59,7.07,4.81,1.20,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.20,0.30
t3_3bx3hw,"there are very few queer spaces. the vast majority of the world is focused on the comfort of straight people, often to the exclusion of lgbtq people. you sound like a decent guy. you are not homophobic, you want your girlfriend to feel safe, and you just want to relax and have a drink. all that is totally okay. but there is a cycle to gay bars that you and your girlfriend have become a part of. you start off with a gay bar and all the gay guys are there having a gay ol' time. then women start to go, because, as your girlfriend pointed out, they feel safer there. and that in and of itself is okay. sure, the gay guys would probably rather just do their own thing by themselves, but the women's reasons are understandable and they do not pose much of a threat as long as they keep to themselves and do not go shopping for a ""gay bff."" but then the straight guys find out where all the women have gone. next thing you know, there is straight dudes hitting on women who under the assumption that they are in a safe space *and* these straight dudes tend to not respond very well to being hit on by men. sometimes there is overt anger, even violence. but most often, it is this flash of disgust on their faces that makes you feel like the lowest, most disgusting person on earth. all in a space that was once safe, that once *celebrated* gayness. now this gay safe space is gone. maybe you can move to another space because another bar will rise to fill the need for a new queer space. or maybe city government will deny them a liquor license (as i have seen happen in many small towns). maybe no one has the resources. maybe the original owner of the bar is unhappy because they are gay too, and now the business they have poured their heart and souls into is turning into just another sketchy straight bar, and they just do not have the energy to try again. the reason the other patrons (and the bartender) are uncomfortable with the presence of a very obviously hetro couple is because they have all, at some point, been on the receiving end of that look of pure disgust just because they have accidentally hit on a straight dude (or were even *perceived* as flirting) and because they do not want to loose their favorite bar either. to clarify a point before i continue: the people saying that it is illegal to deny you service are (probably) wrong. it depends on where you live, but the vast majority of the country does not have protections for discrimination based on sexual orientation. if your city/county/state doesn't, then it is not illegal. so, i get it. this bar fits your needs perfectly: close by, shows sports, your girlfriend feels safe there... i understand the appeal. i am not going to defend the bartender asking you to leave, but i am going to ask that you reconsider before going to a gay bar again. even though lgbtq rights have made some great progress over the past few years, for most of us, we grew up in a time and in families that weren't so accepting. even now, violence against us continues. bulling leading to depression and suicide continues. being queer in a straight world is not easy. even when you get past the overt hostility, there is all these reminders that we are *different* and not entirely welcome. so we create queer spaces. little oases of freedom to celebrate ourselves, where we (ideally) do not have to worry about accidentally hitting on straight people, where we just be our genuine selves without judgement. your obvious hetrosexual presence, while not uniquely harmful, pops that bubble. it sets us on edge and is a reminder that we are not safe, that we do not get our own spaces. and that this bar, like so many gay bars before it, will soon be no more. and although your wants and needs are valid too, i ask that you respect that this is something we need as a community. so maybe next time you are thinking of hitting up the bar because it is the closest one that's suitable for you and your girlfriend, decide to drive somewhere instead. not for your sake, but to support our communities by giving us a little space. sometimes, that's the best way to be an ally and a friend. smile",csqiv1q,842.3625199534727,1,1435889513,412,43,12963,0,73.1145588235294,765.0,1042.0,42.0,1,0.07142857142857142,0.0,0.21428571428571427,0.5714285714285714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023809523809523808,0.16666666666666666,0.0,1.0476190476190477,0.040074241078545236,0.21045751633986928,0.0,0,0.0,767,45.63,85.16,59.38,62.85,17.84,16.17,93.48,58.28,14.60,8.74,0.91,2.09,3.52,0.00,2.22,5.74,7.17,12.26,9.26,7.30,7.56,2.74,16.56,7.69,2.87,0.78,0.52,3.39,6.13,4.04,2.09,0.39,0.39,0.39,13.30,0.13,1.96,0.52,0.65,14.47,2.48,1.96,1.56,3.13,1.69,4.82,1.56,0.39,0.26,0.65,4.04,0.26,0.13,1.96,1.69,8.47,4.04,1.17,1.96,0.78,1.43,1.43,13.69,1.43,15.78,1.83,9.39,4.82,0.65,2.48,0.13,0.26,0.13,0.13,0.91,0.00,0.13,0.26,0.13,0.00,14.60,5.74,4.95,0.26,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.26,0.78,1.30,1.30

t3_2x9bc1,"srs can seem like an abrasive and offensive community. the question is why? the way i see it, is the main purpose of srs is twofold: 1. to call out the legitimately fucked up things, racism, sexism, homophobia, pedos, miscellaneous bigotry that crops up on reddit and is often upvoted. 2. the provide a place where people can vent and satirize #1. i do not think they claim to be the most productive way to end the issues in #1. rather, it is a place to vent and ""circlejerk"" with people who will see this set of issues in a similar way. for example, if i want to jerk with fellow new yorker residents i might go to /r/nyc (everything is expensive, my apartment is literally the size of a matchbox, insert nyc jerk here, blah blah). if i want to jerk about pc gaming i might go to /r/gaming (gaben is our lord, pcmasterrace, steam sales hurt my wallet, insert gaming jerk here, blah blah) srs is the place where people jerk about the prevalence of legitimately messed up stuff that crops up on reddit. interrupting the jerk will cause backlash of course just as it might in any other circle. if you go to /r/gaming dwight schrute style and say ""actually, mobile game revenues set to overtake console and pc games in 2015"" or you go to /r/nyc and say ""actually, luanda, angola and hong kong have higher costs of living than new york city"" then you might face a ridiculing, albeit immature response from the participants of that in-group circle. similarly with srs, if one goes and tries to debate the relative efficacy of anita sarkeesian's video series, one will face a similar response. there are separate forums allocating to circlejerking versus actual debate, and i believe there is srsdiscussion subreddits that will welcome debating stuff like anita sarkeesian. thus, any in-group community can seem abrasive and offensive to those who are on the outside, even if those on the outside are acting in good faith. the frustration that some people on reddit have with srs seems to come from misunderstandings like: 1. they mistakenly believe that the /r/shitredditsays subreddit intends to be a place for productive discussion or solving of issues, or legitimate debate. this is false, it is a place for venting. 2. they do not agree that sometimes, some people on reddit say shitty things. this is really a separate discussion, but suffice it to say, i think most reasonable people would agree that shitty stuff does get said from time to time on a form as large as reddit. 3. they fundamentally do not understand issues concerning modern discrimination or they assume that all participants of srs hyperbolically hold the **most** extreme social justice views possible. i sometimes appreciate the satirical nature of srs, but the last post i made on /r/changemyview actually is somewhat supportive of ""mens rights"" in child support/alimony cases. hopefully this helps clear up some confusion.",coy2y99,288.8861891413429,1,1424977774,87,8,2408,0,57.05399263803682,489.0,751.0,25.0,85,0.04,0.04,0.16,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04,0.12,0.0,0.04,0.0,0.8400000000000001,0.05431236972903639,0.294478527607362,0.0,0,0.0,506,84.78,55.49,38.00,8.99,20.24,18.77,80.63,46.64,9.88,4.15,2.37,0.20,0.59,0.00,0.99,5.73,6.13,14.62,7.31,3.95,5.14,0.59,12.85,3.56,2.77,0.99,1.98,2.57,5.34,1.98,3.36,0.00,2.96,0.20,9.09,0.00,0.20,0.00,0.40,14.82,2.77,2.37,2.17,6.52,0.79,4.74,2.57,1.38,0.99,0.20,1.38,0.99,0.20,0.20,0.00,5.14,1.98,0.79,1.98,0.40,0.00,0.59,10.87,1.98,11.46,1.19,7.71,2.17,1.19,2.37,0.40,0.79,0.40,0.00,4.15,0.79,2.17,0.40,0.00,0.79,17.98,4.74,5.93,0.40,0.00,0.20,0.00,0.40,1.58,0.20,0.79,3.75

t3_321v5o,"> the workers do not have a claim on the future tax receipts of the federal government though. under us law, there is no property interest in future social security payments.[2] if the us treasury defaulted on those bonds, the only entity who could sue would be the ssa, in a case titled united states v. united states. ok, you have taken some half truths and you have jumped to some conclusions. let us start with the premise: > under us law, there is no property interest in future social security payments. that's true. if you are talking about ""property"" in the sense that payments into an ""account"" can be withdrawn later. but that's not the only meaning of ""property."" *any* statutory entitlement is ""property"" for the purposes of the due process clause after deprivation of that property. so the moment the social security administration misses a payment, as calculated by the statutory formulas, the federal government (regular treasury) must pay all plaintiffs who sue it. in that sense, [it is ""property""](> concurrently with the virtual demise of the ""right-privilege"" distinction, there arose the ""entitlement"" doctrine, under which the court erected a barrier of procedural?but not substantive?protections against erroneous governmental deprivation of something it had within its discretion bestowed. previously, the court had limited due process protections to constitutional rights, traditional rights, common law rights and ""natural rights."" now, under a new ""positivist"" approach, a protected property or liberty interest might be found based on any positive governmental statute or governmental practice that gave rise to a legitimate expectation. indeed, for a time it appeared that this positivist conception of protected rights was going to displace the traditional sources. > as noted previously, the advent of this new doctrine can be seen in goldberg v. kelly. in goldberg, the court held that, inasmuch as termination of welfare assistance may deprive an eligible recipient of the means of livelihood, the government must provide a pre-termination evidentiary hearing in which an initial determination of the validity of the dispensing agency's grounds for termination could be made. in order to reach this conclusion, the court found that such benefits ""are a matter of statutory entitlement for persons qualified to receive them."" thus, where the loss or reduction of a benefit or privilege was conditioned upon specified grounds, it was found that the recipient had a property interest entitling him to proper procedure before termination or revocation. ok, so people who reach the statutory qualifications for receiving social security benefits would be able to sue. (in fact, people already do that today when wrongly denied social security benefits, especially under the disability or survivor programs). that does not mean that congress can't change the program, either, but it also doensn't mean that congress can't just pay social security's obligations out of the general treasury accounts. it does it with medicare, and that cost has been growing faster than revenue and faster than inflation for decades now. > would be curious for any replies related to what happens when the trust fund ""runs out."" the social security trust fund was created in the 1980's and designed to ""run out"" around the time the boomers all die off. that generation is the only one expected to have a disproportionate number of retirees (aka social security beneficiaries) compared to the number of workers. once they die off, a stable ratio of 65+ to 18-65 should be restored (although slightly higher than historical because of lower birth rate and higher life expectancy), and the program should stabilize for at about 6.1% of gdp. that's hardly a recipe for disaster (and in fact, so much else can go wrong instead before 2088). [there's more information here](basically, the big problem is medicare, not social security. social security has some issues, too, but it will never account for more than a tiny portion of our gdp. some of that can be fixed with just tweaks around the edges (like increasing the limit on wages subject to ss tax, paying for disability insurance out of the general revenue instead of ss funds, etc.).",cq7b3vb,1736.5291643528149,1,1428636444,43,8,14887,0,41.42807162835419,673.0,1156.0,34.0,5,0.058823529411764705,0.029411764705882353,0.17647058823529413,0.4411764705882353,0.0,0.029411764705882353,0.0,0.029411764705882353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029411764705882353,0.0,0.7941176470588235,0.05920702412797274,0.2823179791976226,0.0,0,0.0,685,90.44,52.34,30.60,90.66,22.10,29.05,81.61,48.47,7.30,1.61,0.00,0.73,0.44,0.15,0.29,5.69,9.49,15.04,8.18,5.11,4.67,1.46,11.53,5.11,3.07,1.31,1.46,1.90,6.86,5.40,1.46,0.00,0.00,0.88,5.40,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.15,13.43,2.19,1.17,2.19,2.92,2.34,4.53,1.02,0.29,0.29,0.00,0.58,0.00,0.58,0.00,0.00,11.97,2.48,1.61,4.09,1.31,2.92,3.36,8.03,1.46,13.58,2.04,6.42,5.55,5.26,0.00,0.00,3.36,0.00,0.44,0.44,0.00,0.00,0.44,0.00,0.00,20.15,4.82,5.55,0.15,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.44,3.50,1.46,2.04,2.19

t3_3bc4if,"the best arguments against polygamy are not moral-there is not anything morally wrong with multiple spouses if everyone agrees-they're practical. marriage is a major status change that you choose to enter with another person. it means the law acknowledges who can visit you in the hospital, make decisions for you if you are sick, raise your kids if you die or make decisions for them if you are absent, who can share your bank account and affect your credit rating, and who gets half your stuff in divorce. marriage is a major change in your rights and responsibilities towards specific other people. when you can only be married to one person at a time, both people have to consent to it. that changes with polygamy. i agree to marry my wife, but what if later she wants to also marry her boyfriend or girlfriend? can this third partner make decisions for the children i had with my original wife? does the third partner get part of the property my wife and i accumulated together if they divorce out? does their debt affect my credit score? with polygamy, your rights and responsibilities towards specific people can change *without* your consent, if one spouse chooses to marry someone else. and what if the new spouse is also married?. you might end up with a lot of people you do not know/didn't choose having the ability to majorly impact your life. edit: i see that you respond to these kinds of arguments by suggesting people contract around it, but this is not a workable solution for marriage. 1) ideally, marriages last for the rest of your life. 50+ years. there is just no way to foresee and contract for every situation where you will have the opportunity to impact your spouses over that kind of time span. marriage is fundamentally accepting the risk of future uncertainties with another person, of having to deal with the unforeseen together. that's why it is so important that people explicitly agree to the person they take that risk with. they can't effectively contract for all the unknowns and separate risks, and they might not want to be bound by the exact terms of an agreement they signed 20 years ago anyway. love lives are not great places for contracts. 2) even in the seemingly simple areas where you would think you can contract, you can't. like with property, income does not stay separated once it comes in to the household, and in divorce judges try to compensate people who sacrificed career opportunities in service of the family unit. there is no neat way to divide it into fractions or to give that paper fraction actual meaning out of your household property and bank account, and it will inevitably impact the spouse who did not marry the third spouse. prenups between relatively simple two-spouse marriages are overturned, redrafted, or declared void all the time; the sense of predictability they offer is illusive, especially if you move states (every state has its own divorce laws). they wouldn't help much at all with polygamous marriages. things can go wrong with your spouse, but you consented to the risk by marrying them. things can go wrong with your children, but you accepted that risk by having and keeping children. things go wrong with your spouse's spouse, and you didn't have to sign up for it to ruin your credit or garnish your wages or otherwise massively impact your life. that's an issue, and it can't be easily solved by introducing more contracts into personal relationships.",cslj62e,1537.1990940431638,1,1435540300,162,23,74636,0,58.39604519774011,590.0,896.0,30.0,8,0.1,0.03333333333333333,0.13333333333333333,0.26666666666666666,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.0,0.6333333333333333,0.0798991238646411,0.2457627118644068,0.0,0,0.0,597,57.77,93.19,29.42,44.14,19.90,20.44,89.78,53.43,15.91,9.21,1.34,0.00,5.86,0.34,1.68,6.70,5.03,13.74,8.38,2.85,6.53,2.85,11.73,3.02,0.67,1.84,2.01,2.18,5.86,3.35,2.35,1.01,0.34,0.17,19.93,5.19,0.67,0.84,0.17,15.75,3.02,2.18,2.35,4.02,2.18,6.70,0.34,0.17,0.00,0.00,1.17,0.00,1.01,0.00,0.00,12.06,6.20,1.51,2.18,1.51,1.51,1.17,10.72,1.34,9.38,2.01,5.36,2.18,2.85,0.17,0.50,1.84,0.34,0.17,0.50,0.00,0.00,0.34,0.00,0.17,12.90,4.36,3.85,0.17,0.17,0.84,0.00,0.50,0.00,1.68,0.67,0.67

t3_3ftpjw,"for some background, i study in the area of environmental economics and have a keen interest in international relations and psychology- hopefully this is easy to read and follow! > i think this for a few reasons. first, i think that a group of humans (or any animal) acting reaonably for their own self-interest will eventually harm the group as a whole. this is called the tradgedy of the commons. i also think this plays out on wider scales with countries. examples include the us propping up dictatorships to prevent the spread of communism, france and the uk colonizing a large amount of the world and russia invading ukraine. while the tragedy of the commons can be used as a concept in your argument, you have not got it quite right here. the international relations concept that your examples describe is based around [realism](which generally includes the arms races, security dilemmas and self-interest of your examples- this all comes from the anarchy of global government, i.e. there is no global government that can *make* national governments behave. while the world of ir can be pretty depressing sometimes (why i do not study it proper), [liberalism](seems to have been winning the fight recently between the two traditional schools of thought. the [tragedy of the commons](is sort of related, in that it is a result of self-interest without proper governance to stop abuse, but it is generally restricted to environmental economics and sometimes evolutionary biology. the wiki link is pretty good at explaining it so i will not do that here, but if you are interested elinor ostrom, the first woman to win a nobel prize in economics, has done amazing work on this concept. this [article](is a great summary of her work in the area. i think that elinor's work actually says a lot about human progress and problem solving. we have had commons for hundreds if not thousands of years, and *theoretically* they should all be ruined- humans do not follow economic or social theories when they are bad for us (we are normally smarter as a species than you might think!). we will always be creating new problems for ourselves, sometimes big ones that could severely damage ourselves and our planet if we can't solve them- but that's why we are still here. humans are problem-solvers, and we are getting better at it. finally, if you would like to read a really excellent book on humanity's progress (it does seem so down and out, getting worse every day sometimes), *the better angels of our nature* by steven pinker explores violence through the history of humanity and how we are the most peaceful we have ever been- by a long way!

t3_3amjrk,"the issue with taxes are the impact it has on the person you are taxing. firstly, a 15% flat tax would be a significant decrease in tax revenues, so that's unrealistically low. the issue with taxes is what activity are the people you are taxing giving up to pay for the taxes. the more someone earns, the more likely that paying taxes is only cutting into luxury expenses. currently, the bottom 20% of earners pay a total tax rate of about 8%, so you are essentially doubling the taxes on poor people. this is taking money out of budgets for food, housing, and basic expenses. when you are making $20k per year, losing another 8% of your income to taxes is devastating. if you are making $500k per year, a tax cut means you maybe take extra nice vacations or buy the biggest mercedes instead of the 2nd biggest. additionally, spending on basic stuff is most beneficial to the economy. tax cuts for lower income people generate more economic activity than tax cuts for wealthy people. any time you are generating economic growth, you are also growing future tax revenues, so cutting taxes for poor people ultimately allows you to lower the overall tax burden. taxing lower income people has a much larger effect on children. lowering a families ability to invest in essential things for their kids leads to lower educational achievement, higher rates of behavioral problems and crime, etc. these all have a steep economic cost down the road. >it seems to me that it is punishing somebody for making more money, making it more desirable to stay in the middle class instead of encouraging people to work their way up into a higher class. there is no point in our tax system where making more money results in you taking less home. the top marginal rate is less than 40%. you get to keep a bit less of that extra dollar, but you always have more to spend when you make more money. additionally, consider that after a certain income all your basic expenses are met, and any additional money you make is 100% disposable. >but would still be encouraged to leave their capital in the us economy instead of finding ways around the tax code investments are taxed as capital gains, which are flat as you have described. a flat tax does nothing to discourage seeking ways around taxes. if you have $100 k, and the tax is 15%, as long as you can avoid the tax for less than $15k, you are going to do it because at the end of the day you end up with more money.",cse2b43,575.0598888278138,1,1434920026,29,14,5794,0,59.625508757297766,436.0,655.0,22.0,2,0.045454545454545456,0.0,0.2727272727272727,0.13636363636363635,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45454545454545453,0.16415343915343913,0.2408256880733945,0.0,0,0.0,444,85.23,87.92,23.51,6.05,20.18,16.44,89.86,46.85,10.36,6.08,0.23,0.45,4.73,0.00,0.68,4.28,7.66,14.41,8.33,4.28,4.50,0.45,14.19,11.04,7.66,1.13,2.25,5.63,5.41,1.80,3.60,0.23,0.23,2.03,9.68,0.23,0.00,0.00,0.00,11.04,1.13,3.15,1.35,2.93,1.58,2.48,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.23,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.23,10.36,1.35,1.80,5.41,1.80,1.35,0.45,11.04,0.45,14.19,1.58,9.68,3.15,10.36,0.45,0.68,13.29,0.00,0.00,0.23,0.00,0.23,0.23,0.00,0.00,13.06,4.95,4.95,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.23,0.00,2.93

t3_3247v7,"this is an interesting idea. and one that strikes oddly close to home for me. haha, hear me out. i play a lot of vampire the masquerade in a [persistent worldwide larp setting](think that game specifically addresses and even makes a mechanic of what you are missing. humanity. sure, being a vampire comes with some cool benefits. in vtm, these are the various disciplines a vampire can master -?auspex, obfuscate,?dominate.?there are inherent strengths, like the?ability to just straight up increase your physical prowess through the blood. but there is the rub. you marginalize the ""minor weaknesses."" first, lets address your list of them. now in vtm they do not all apply to all vampires - religious iconography only harms one clan (which constitutes 10% of all vampires, granted) and the odd lick here and there, garlic even fewer. but consider that it means losing what makes you human. you can't go out in the sun. if there were absolutely no other biological change except that the sun kills you, your newfound vitamin d deficiency would drive you to suicide (this is the root of seasonal affective disorder). but you would also have to kill to live. even if you didn't kill, you are either stealing or living off of other peoples sacrifice. for normal people, that's a pretty big deal. i feel guilty when i kill an animal, i can't imagine killing a person. the point of the game is that it is supposed to be a story of personal horror - of the struggle to maintain yourself against the beast that lies beneath the surface. as you act more and more monstrous, the monster comes free. the more you violate your ethics, the faster your slide to wassail (loss of self). i have not watched twilight or true blood, actually - despite playing vtm frequently, those seemed too contrived for my taste. i think a better way to look at it is to look at the specific characters in various works. here is a quick exercise where i will compare two typical brooding characters with others in their setting. **louis de pointe du lac** in anne rice's *vampire chronicles*. louis was embraced (made a vampire) when he was depressed and seeking death. for years he had been trying to get himself killed. he was *depressed* and *suicidal* to begin with. this is a character flaw in louis, not necessarily a misinterpretation of the situation by anne rice.?by contrast, lestat de lioncourt?fell in love with being a vampire. he thought it was the?best thing ever. as soon as he?learned how to make others, he went and?embraced his lover?nicolas,?then he embraced his?mother. most of the other characters loved being immortal and the powers that came with it - especially lestat. but daniel malloy (the interviewer in interview with the vampire) is another great example - he begged repeatedly to be made a vampire before armand finally relented. and lets look at buffy the vampire slayer.?there are really two vamps who stand out in this one. angel and spike - of course. buffy has an interesting mechanic in-universe where vampires lose their souls on being turned, and so relish the destruction they bring. this is why they are villains, typically. they are part demon, thus they go all bumpy forehead, and some of the stronger demon wards work against them as well (though usually their demon-ness is so light that they are under the radar for those, and pure demons make fun of them). so for this exercise we will compare spike and angel. both (spoilers) have souls at one point. angel's soul is given to him as a burden. he has cursed by gypsies after killing one, the curse being that he would regain his soul. the reason he turns dark and broody (which, by the way, is frequently made fun of by just about every other character, even giles) is because he has burdened with the regret of what he did without his soul. he remembers his time with darla, with spike and dru, everyone he killed, his involvement in the october revolution, and every heinous thing he did along the way. he regrets it all. spike, meanwhile, seeks to get his soul back so that buffy will love him. all in all, i liked the spike/buffy storyline (which included their most difficult scene in the show) far more than the buffy/angel thing.?but when spike gets his soul back, he does not get all broody. he takes a minute to reflect and mourn his lost humanity, but otherwise he has still pretty much spike - now a cross between the johnny rotton/billy idol wannabe and the lovelorn poet he was as a human. which...lead to him being pretty badass, actually. best line: ""i may be loves bitch, but at least i am man enough to admit it."" point being: it is all about perspective. in both cases, it is true that the *character* is off-base from your perspective. but that's what stories are all about. exploring different perspectives. i have played characters who lamented the loss of their humanity - one was constantly mocked by?a close friend of his for being such a bleeding heart. another was a complete and utter monster. yet another thought being a vampire was really cool, that he had evolved beyond humanity. it is all in perspective. the fiction itself is not off-base. just like you would?think being immortal is awesome, there are people out there who would be devastated at staying young forever, and watching everyone they know and love grow old and die. there are people like me, who would rather die than kill with any regularity to live - do not get me wrong, i would fight for my life if attacked, but i would rather die than have to kill once a night, or month, or even year, just to stay alive. yea, being a vampire would be cool. for some people. sociopaths, mainly.",cq81v9f,1739.2559863855192,1,1428696863,93,21,21311,0,68.09985123918206,983.0,1444.0,69.0,4,0.043478260869565216,0.028985507246376812,0.2028985507246377,0.3333333333333333,0.014492753623188406,0.014492753623188406,0.014492753623188406,0.028985507246376812,0.014492753623188406,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07246376811594203,0.028985507246376812,0.7971014492753622,0.03086060181648417,0.2634791454730417,0.0,0,0.0,1008,57.76,70.40,14.99,15.92,15.75,18.45,85.62,54.86,15.08,9.13,1.88,0.30,1.88,3.57,1.49,5.95,7.04,12.70,9.03,6.45,5.85,1.09,15.87,5.26,3.27,1.88,1.09,3.57,7.54,3.37,4.07,0.30,1.88,1.19,11.21,0.10,0.20,0.10,3.67,13.89,2.08,1.49,1.69,2.48,2.68,4.86,1.59,0.79,0.10,0.50,2.38,0.50,1.09,0.10,0.20,5.36,1.29,1.59,1.79,1.19,0.60,3.27,10.12,0.60,11.21,1.98,5.56,4.17,0.89,0.89,0.20,0.10,1.79,2.08,0.99,0.20,0.20,0.60,0.10,0.00,18.65,7.04,5.26,0.20,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.39,0.40,0.69,1.88,1.79

t3_36iee8,"i am going to take a different approach from the other posters by discussing what a ""socialist"" president would do and how it affects the argument. firstly, what does bernie sanders want?: 1. universal healthcare. 2. universal basic income. 3. free college tuition. 4. a reigned in spying system. 5. an end to unnecessary military interventions. 6. an end to wall street profiteering. 7. pro renewable energy and anti fossil subsidies/global warming that's basically what he is pushing for (as far as i know; not sure what his position is on immigration). now you have to ask yourself how much these things cost. 1. medicaid and medicare cost a combined $773 billion (2013, so before most of the aca benefits kicked in). could not find a solid number, but some of the private provider numbers imply private insurers made about $650 billion in revenues in 2010 which becomes about 700 billion if adjusted to 2013. giving the cost of providing care to all the people in the system as of 2013 at about $1.47 trillion a year. if you factor in the uninsured (about 15% of the population). the same costs would be $1.73 trillion 2. the 2010 census says there are 243,275,505 adults and 74,181,467 minors. if every adult was given $12,000 a year and every child $4,000, the program would cost $2.919 trillion for adults, and $298 billion for the children. 3. the amount of tuition charged in 2012 was $69 billion. if the number tripled every year for 12 years due to increased demand and also increased 5% a year it would amount to $3.12 trillion or about $260 billion a year. 4. a few different sources say it is about 80 billion a year to run us intelligence in general. 5. iraq and afghanistan cost the us anywhere between $4 and 6 trillion depending on who you ask. 6. [this nyt article puts the cost of the 2008 recession at 4-25 trillion dollars.](so let us split the difference and call it $14.5 trillion. 7. fossil fuel subsidies cost $38 billion annually, climate change will cost 1.9 trillion dollars by 2100, this amounts to about 24 billion a year on average (these numbers are just for the atlantic and gulf states and do not take into account drought damage as i could not find a solid source for that(the likelier number is probably 3x that much). so let us figure these numbers in to what we are currently dealing with. 1. using united healthcare as a basis, 4.6% of revenue is profit for private insurers. most patented drugs are hundreds of times more expensive than they cost to make and hospitals jump at any opportunity to overcharge patients. [if this article is any indication, negotiating down the price of patented drugs could save as much as $200 billion a year](if you take all these numbers and do not account for a number of other things that would further reduce costs (ceo pay, removing the middlemen, across the board forced negotiations), uh would cost about $1.48 trillion and cover everyone. 2. all the various current forms of welfare amount to about $220 billion, removing redundancy lowers the actual bill to almost exactly 3 trillion a year for this. 3. removing existing government supported educational grants lowers the actual cost of this to $220 billion. 4. even a 15% funding cut lowers the cost of intelligence to about $68 billion. 5. at 4 trillion since 2001 (the most conservative measures), just not being in afghanistan or iraq amounts to 286 billion a year. 6. this is 2.42 trillion a year, between 2008 and 2015. if you assume these downturns happen every 20 years, then the actual cost is $725 billion a year (naturally adjusted to inflation). 7. this amounts to about 60 billion a year. alright, now there is all sorts of other factors. one of the most damaging factors to our economic growth is that employers in this country are saddled with the costs of providing their employees healthcare. as previously shown, this is both expensive and inefficient due to everybody in the chain wanting to profit. universal healthcare would embolden every employer in the us. [8% of civilian and private employee benefits and 11.6% of state and federal employee benefits are health/insurance benefits.](if this windfall directly translated to jobs, the result would be 12.3 million new jobs. if it only translated to a proportional 20% gain in new jobs, it would still result in 2.46 million new jobs. another factor: ubi money does not poof out of the economy the same way ceo pay does, the poor and middle class people would spend the majority of this new money. if 85% is put directly back into the economy (a reasonable number), it would result in 2.55 trillion in new consumer spending. if you assume corporations will hire a new employee for every 1.5 million that they make, the result would be 1.7 million new jobs. not to mention sales taxes boosting state revenues. free tuition would result in a couple 10k new high paying jobs (university staff) and a temporary boost of several 10k more construction employees for construction. so what does a bernie sanders presidency (where he gets everything he wants) get you? free healthcare and education for everyone. enough income to get most of your basic affairs in order. a much more stable world and economy. 5 million new jobs. if you cut 200b from the defense budget the result is a 5.5 trillion yearly expense budget, in comparison to the current one which if you figure in the various wars and wall street instability is about 4.6 trillion. factor in the dependant tax credit redundancy (-60 billion) and the fact that none of the 12 million illegal immigrants would receive these benefits (-112 billion), the final cost is an added 780 billion expenditure a year. all of the new jobs and the resulting total increase in income tax revenues might well cover most if not all of the difference. ps: if we perfectly matched canada's per capita health expenditure, it would cost us 951 billion to cover everyone's healthcare. **this would lower the final added expenditure to only 251 billion.** **tl;dr:** if you do everything bernie sanders wants, the result is an extra 251 billion in expenditures a year. if you do not include ubi (which is currently the most expensive thing and the hardest sell), you get a 2.6 trillion *drop* in expenditures. **edit:** [his proposition of a robin hood tax. this would cover those extra 251 billion, dropping the final expenditure to -49 billion against the previous year.](",crez4hc,81.68843971421933,1,1432132199,45,11,49232,0,62.15817513735581,1013.0,1608.0,99.0,1,0.020202020202020204,0.0,0.020202020202020204,0.06060606060606061,0.0,0.0,0.010101010101010102,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010101010101010102,0.0,0.12121212121212122,NaN,0.23000987166831194,0.0,0,0.0,1120,89.26,60.91,7.63,47.21,14.55,23.84,78.84,42.59,8.21,3.04,0.27,0.80,1.25,0.45,0.27,5.18,8.57,12.41,5.98,3.21,5.71,0.98,9.73,5.36,2.95,1.16,13.39,4.55,3.30,2.23,1.07,0.00,0.18,0.36,5.71,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.45,12.77,0.80,2.41,3.66,3.48,2.23,3.75,0.36,0.00,0.18,0.18,0.71,0.00,0.71,0.00,0.00,5.54,0.80,0.27,2.68,1.88,0.18,0.89,6.79,0.62,11.70,1.52,5.45,4.82,5.36,0.00,0.00,6.16,0.00,0.09,0.27,0.00,0.00,0.09,0.18,0.00,19.20,7.05,3.12,0.45,0.18,0.18,0.00,0.36,0.18,0.27,2.77,4.64
t3_2yszp3,"this claim really is not refutable. if we stop all emissions tomorrow, the climate is still going to change. we would probably still lose all of greenland's ice by the end of the century. at this point we are trying to slow the rate of change so that we can buy more time for adaptation efforts and hopefully put the lid back on pandora's box. i understand why this might make you feel awful. so let me give you two general themes that might make you a little more optimistic. 1. the big players are coming around * china is beginning to realize the immediacy of its environmental catastrophe. the last year has seen [china's use of coal shrink](which is remarkable given their past industrial expansion's reliance on coal (the worst fossil fuel). this suggests that china is finally beginning to manage a policy that might reign in its carbon emissions. this would be a huge win. * banks are beginning count carbon into their long term evaluations of a companies profitability. hsbc in it is predictions for several energy companies suggest that they [overvalued by up to 40%](assuming that governments and industry move to reign in emissions within the next 10-20yrs (a la copenhagen accords). environmental groups are one thing, but when banks are doing it something is going to happen. * environmental campaigns like [divest and fossil free are exploding](in popularity across the world. universities, charities, religious groups, and now even nations (norway) are divesting. the resurgence of these campaigns may force national action in the near future. 2. their might be a technical solution * carbon capture is still relatively new but it could be tremendously important. it is currently quite energy intensive but with more groups looking into it there might be a break through. if this break through is effective at the ppm range, we might be able to start recovering co2. and certain methods for recovering co2 such as using it to produce caco3 can even fight the effects of climate change, with nations like [singapore]( using the process to produce reinforcement for the island. * there might a be a crazy idea like shooting so2 in the upper atmosphere to decrease the amount of solar radiation making it to earth. this idea is fraught with problems and possible outcomes but something of this sort might be a viable last ditch effort.",cpcsn2z,72.66386259512416,1,1426188706,17,6,9455,0,58.74704017476557,391.0,608.0,24.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.2916666666666667,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.041666666666666664,0.6666666666666666,0.02158541941150637,0.3248081841432225,0.0,0,0.0,397,78.25,65.67,46.02,49.19,16.54,22.67,82.12,50.13,10.58,3.53,0.50,1.26,0.76,0.00,1.01,7.05,7.30,13.60,10.58,5.04,4.03,0.25,15.62,4.03,2.02,0.76,1.51,2.52,4.28,2.77,1.51,0.00,0.25,0.25,4.79,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,14.11,2.52,4.28,1.76,5.04,0.76,2.02,1.01,0.50,0.25,0.25,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,8.82,2.02,2.27,3.53,0.76,1.01,0.76,10.33,4.03,17.13,2.52,8.06,6.55,3.78,0.00,0.00,1.51,0.25,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,15.11,6.05,1.76,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.25,0.00,1.01,2.52,3.53

t3_3i9n2q,"it is always frustrating when people rail against feminists who say outrageous things without actually providing links to the offending speech, since it forces other feminists to apologize for what might be a misrepresentation of the thing they actually said. but here goes nothing: 1. a feminist might say that men should not use violence against women because men are powerful enough to defend themselves against women without needing to resort to very much violence, or any violence at all. what they are trying to express might be the idea that since you are only justified in using as much force as is reasonable to prevent harm to yourself, and that men could in most cases prevent a woman from inflicting any sort of meaningful harm on them with a very minimal use of force, men should not use very much force when protecting themselves from women. i think this is an overgeneralization; some men are really weak and some women are really strong, and that matters in evaluating when and how much force is justified. some men are perfectly justified in using a lot of force against a woman to defend themselves. but the underlying principle, that men should be careful not to use too much force when defending themselves against women, is a good one, and i do not think it very charitable to declare all of contemporary feminism flawed because some, *not all*, feminists are making a hasty generalization. 2. this one is easy; a tree is not a moral agent with a duty to respect your autonomy, so getting drunk and crashing into a tree is entirely your fault. however, a person who wants to have sex with you *is* a moral agent with a duty to respect your autonomy, and if such a person decides to fuck you while your capacity for rational decision making has been subverted by alcohol, they are raping you. so comparing a drunk driving accident to being raped while intoxicated is a disanalogy. feminists see this bad comparison made *a lot*, so you are not alone in this error. it is like the [wasson selection task](of feminist thought. 3. if you ask feminists about the draft, most will give you a two pronged answer; first, that women should be allowed to serve in the military in any capacity in which they are able, including combat, and second, that nobody should be forced to serve against their will. that's an implicit argument that the draft is unjust, so essentially you are asking why feminists are not outraged that women are not also subjected to this unjust treatment which men are subjected. if they are right that any sort of draft is unjust, and i think they are, then you are asking feminists to beat women down here rather than raise men up, which is a perverted sort of justice if you ask me. you might want to say that feminists should advocate for ending the draft, and that's fine. problem is, feminist activists tend to be women, and women are perfectly justified in focusing on issues that affect them. they are not obligated to focus their activism on men's issues. feminists who are men are perfectly capable of addressing the draft issue, and should do just that. heck, you could do that yourself, right now! alright, so to wrap this up; if you approach feminism in good faith and in a non-facile way, you are going to find that the project as a whole is not at all flawed or hypocritical. unfortunately, it is pretty obvious your exposure to feminism has been via the bad faith arguments typical of the mra/redpill/etc. movements. i highly recommend learning about feminism from sources that are not explicitly hostile to it. read bell hooks' [*feminism is for everybody*](it is a really great intro to feminism, especially for people like you who have been exposed to it uncharitably. e: also, i am only going to reply to op.",cufiuhn,1153.2827959229871,1,1440540810,100,14,76826,0,52.259148330804265,659.0,1018.0,28.0,2,0.2857142857142857,0.0,0.14285714285714285,0.10714285714285714,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.0,0.07142857142857142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10714285714285714,0.0,0.7499999999999999,0.14316712094489872,0.2291350531107739,0.0,0,0.0,667,53.74,75.49,10.56,8.08,23.82,20.69,86.51,55.62,13.34,6.45,0.90,0.00,3.30,0.00,2.25,6.90,5.85,14.09,11.54,5.40,6.45,2.40,17.69,2.25,1.50,2.25,1.20,3.45,6.30,2.40,3.90,0.00,1.50,0.15,12.89,0.00,0.00,1.80,1.65,19.79,2.85,4.80,2.85,4.20,2.25,5.70,0.90,0.15,0.75,0.00,1.65,0.00,0.45,0.75,0.60,6.75,0.00,1.35,3.30,1.20,1.65,0.75,11.99,1.50,6.90,0.90,4.05,1.95,1.05,0.60,0.00,0.15,0.60,0.00,0.60,0.30,0.15,0.15,0.00,0.00,13.49,4.05,5.25,0.30,0.60,0.00,0.15,0.15,0.00,0.60,0.30,2.10

t3_3d6eeo,">to make sure that you have been reading all the way down to the bottom, i would really appreciate it if you started your post with any word that rhymes with ""crime."" no >or more specifically, it is justified in general when a man gets praise for ?sleeping around"", and it is also justified when the woman does not get the same level of praise for the same behaviour. it seems like the crux of your argument is that it is harder for men to sleep with women than it is for women to sleep with men, and since it is more difficult, it is more impressive and praiseworthy. there are three main problems with your argument. first, i do not think your characterization of the ""stud/slut inequality"" is fair. when people complain that society treats men and women differently in this regard, it is not because women receive less praise than men. it is because women are met with scorn and hostility. if female sexuality was viewed as merely ""unimpressive"", i think that would be a substantial improvement. your argument does not justify hostility, and so i do not think you have attempted to justify the main aspect of this inequality that people care about. second, your hypothesis has no proof. you could equally guess that women should in fact be more promiscuous than men, because they have an incentive to confuse the paternity of their children, ensuring support from as many men as possible. in fact, i think there is much more evidence here in favour of a social explanation. rather than a biological one. it is harder for people to sleep with women because society will criticize women who sleep with multiple people. most importantly, there is no obvious reason why a combination of difficulty and alleged biological incentive make something praiseworthy. there is probably some biological incentive to kill others- less competition for food and mates. it is certainly very difficult to kill someone. is killing someone praiseworthy? would we be justified in praising them?",ct28lpu,599.4273231736474,1,1436830024,58,16,2069,0,56.95889147647884,339.0,528.0,19.0,1,0.05263157894736842,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.47368421052631576,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.631578947368421,NaN,0.24188790560471976,0.0,0,0.0,340,52.27,87.43,12.57,41.74,17.89,21.47,95.00,54.41,13.24,5.59,1.47,0.29,2.94,0.00,0.88,7.65,4.41,14.41,10.88,5.29,6.76,2.35,15.88,7.94,6.47,1.47,1.18,5.00,10.88,5.88,5.00,0.29,2.65,0.00,17.65,0.29,0.29,2.94,2.35,19.12,4.12,4.12,2.65,4.41,2.35,5.29,0.59,0.00,0.00,0.59,4.12,1.47,0.29,1.18,0.29,7.65,1.18,3.82,1.18,0.59,1.18,1.47,12.06,0.29,5.88,0.59,3.24,2.06,1.18,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.88,0.29,0.29,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,12.94,5.00,4.12,0.00,0.00,0.59,0.00,0.29,2.06,0.00,0.00,0.88
t3_38s7v1,"you are missing the point of the shows you name to a certain extent. breaking bad is not about exploring a wide cast of characters, it is about drilling down into the core of a select few characters with a primary focus on walt. characters like hank, marie, and walt jr. are really only relevant to the purpose of the show in how they affect walt (i'd argue this is true about all characters besides walt, but that's an argument for another time). game of thrones is not about characters always doing the most intelligent, logical thing. if anything, it is the opposite: it is a study of the tragedies that inevitably follow from character traits (often traits that are usually seen as positive). ned stark's greatest fault is that he has so honest, honorable, and committed to doing his duty, he can't properly anticipate other people being treacherous and thus gets fooled and betrayed by basically everyone. catelyn's defining trait, her desire to protect her family, leads her to make emotional choices that ultimately end up killing her husband and scattering her family. when characters are not destroyed by their best qualities, they are torn apart time and time again by being forced to choose between two evils. also, this show gets its reputation for surprising deaths due to its reliance on the viewer's awareness of narrative tropes. in a typical show, the good guy investigating corruption and doing the right thing would end up saving the day, or the good king fighting a war against an unjust king would win and set the realm right. by instead showing the realistic consequences of the protagonists' actions, the show counters those implicit beliefs about how fiction should work and ends up surprising people. finally, i wouldn't hold breaking bad or game of thrones up as examples of the best tv has to offer. it is certainly exciting to watch, but tv as a medium is unique because it gives the viewers the chance to get immersed in a world over a long span of time and become attached to characters over years. a tv show that makes optimal use of the advantages of the medium should offer a fully realized world with rich characters, while still creating a technically competent piece. shows such as the wire and mad men fit this mold better than shows like breaking bad (which has a narrower focus, though is still very good) and game of thrones (which often suffers from inconsistent quality and awkward dialogue). that said, if the character map of game of thrones is too much for you, then these kinds of shows may just not be your kind of thing. there is nothing wrong with that, but you are missing out on a rich viewing experience not possible in any other medium.",crxxvxw,795.4708766546731,1,1433636126,89,16,45549,0,53.465642250530806,471.0,706.0,18.0,15,0.2222222222222222,0.05555555555555555,0.3333333333333333,0.16666666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.05555555555555555,0.05555555555555555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1111111111111111,0.05555555555555555,1.1111111111111112,0.07709006679594915,0.31210191082802546,0.0,0,0.0,470,79.13,60.09,16.29,45.30,26.11,22.34,85.96,52.98,10.21,3.83,0.43,0.00,1.06,1.70,0.64,6.38,8.72,15.11,7.66,6.38,7.02,1.70,11.06,5.11,2.98,1.06,0.21,1.49,9.15,5.11,4.04,0.21,1.49,0.85,8.51,0.64,0.21,1.06,1.70,15.53,1.91,2.77,1.91,2.98,2.34,4.89,3.62,3.19,0.21,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,11.49,1.49,2.34,5.32,3.19,1.49,0.85,7.66,0.64,11.49,0.85,6.17,4.47,1.28,1.91,0.43,0.85,0.21,0.64,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,12.34,3.83,4.89,0.21,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.70,1.70,0.00
t3_3c17uc,"let me start by saying i am a fan of win *8.1* (the .1 being the key there). and still appreciate what win8 was trying to do. so my arguments more or less here are to understand why there are a lot of people who hate it. i think it is also worth mentioning that win8 brings a lot of great things to the table (new explorer, new task manager, better under the hood performance, etc) but depending on the person, they probably do not care. > the main complaint seems to be the start screen replacing the start menu. the problem is that it is considered a really jarring experience for a lot of people, and they do not like that. so in order to access your programs in win7 if they weren't pinned to the bar you could just open up the menu while still having a complete view of the desktop. with win8 however, going into the start screen completely tears you out of your working environment so you can access your programs not pinned to the bar. so for some that only have a handful of programs pinned to their start it is incredibly annoying to have an *entire* screen fill up your desktop rather than a small menu on the side. another issue (which i still kinda have with it, even though it does not happen often) is when you accidentally hit the win key it pulls you out of whatever you are working on and into a completely different screen. in win7 if this happened all you would see is the menu pop up and you would just click off it to get back to work. in win8 you have to find the desktop tile and click that, or strike the key again. the process is non-ideal. i also feel that it could have been executed a lot better as far as tile organization goes. you can do two sizes, and stack them in a column. i think they should have taken the ""snap to grid"" approach for icons on the desktop to allow you to stick tiles anywhere on the start screen rather than just form columns and hope they align with your ocd. > if you really hate it you can install something like classic shell to bring back to the start menu i'm an advocate of this, however you have to remember that the majority of pc users are *not* incredibly bright. so for instance if my father wanted to get a new laptop then he has got to figure all that stuff out on his own (not likely), i need to babysit him through the process on the phone, or i need to just do it myself. and since it is a third party software, it is possible that it will break for one reason or another in which case either he has got to fix it (not likely) or i need to fix it (annoying). > to change my view here you should tell me if there is something worse than the start screen in windows 8 that makes it that bad. or if the start screen really is that bad. so depends on who you are. i do not mind the start screen but there are a lot of people who absolutely *loathe* it. other things wrong with win8: - charms menu. every time my cursor wanders over to a corner i get an annoying charms menu pop up. if i have a multi monitor setup (which i do now) if i *do* want to get to the charms i have to balance my cursor between screens, making it nearly impossible to get on a single try. it is also kinda useless. i have nearly forgotten it is there on my desktop since all of its functionality is available elsewhere (at least from what i have used). - lack of start button (fixed with 8.1). in win8 there was no start button, so the only way to get to the start menu was hitting the win key or going all the way to the corner with the cursor. annoying. - shut down (fixed in 8.1, kinda). in win8 if you want to restart/shut down/sleep it is a several key/click process. you need to get to the start menu, then open the charms bar, then select settings, then power options, then select what you want to do. it is a kind of hidden process, and really annoying if you do not know how to do it. once you do know, you think ""why is this a several step process when it should be like win7?"". win 8.1 *kinda* fixes this by allowing you direct access with a right click of the start button, or directly on the start screen. i say *kinda* because a right click is non-ideal and non-obvious and putting it on the start screen means you still need to use the start screen. - direct to start screen on boot (fixed in 8.1, with a settings change). booting up goes right to the start screen rather than the desktop. annoying. fixed with a settings option in 8.1, but it should be default. - full screen apps (kinda fixed with 8.1). full screen apps on a desktop (or even laptop) are a terrible idea. win 8.1 kinda fixes this by docking them on the taskbar, but full screen apps are still a terrible idea. they need to be windowed or the option to have them windowed, period. for someone who wants to look at more than one thing (laptop and desktop users) having mail taking up your entire screen is a drag. - general hidden features. things that should be obvious are hidden. you need to hunt a corner to pop a menu out, accessing ""all apps"" from the start screen there is a *hidden* arrow button, right clicking contextually to find things (like the shut down point before) etc. not to mention all the stuff buried in the charms bar. there is too much hidden stuff that's only nice if you already know where it is. - general touch-oriented approach. a lot of stuff is designed with touch in mind, like the tiles. great if you have a touchscreen, and janky looking if you don't. - too much tied in with ms. they really try to get you to make an ms account, and tie your login with said account. i absolutely hate that. it makes things like onedrive on the desktop inaccessible because of this integration, as opposed to just having the application take whatever credentials it needs. if you chose to shirk making and signing in with an ms account, you lose some of the perks win8 brings to the table. - multiple pc settings areas. so you have got the standard control panel, then you have got this ""settings"" area that has some repetition from control panel, then some other stuff not in control panel that should be integrated into just control panel. it is also a full screen app...ughhhh. so if you want to set something, you have to hunt through an already kinda cryptic control panel, but also through this new settings app. - repetition of functionality. there is a lot of different ways to do one thing. shut down is yet again an example of this. device management is another (control panel, settings app, charms bar). search is another (win+s, start menu then type something, charms bar). there is way too much repetition. so all in all, if you are not a savvy user (like most) then updating is a real pain in the ass. 8.1 does fix a lot of flaws 8 had, and win10 supposedly brings a lot of that stuff even closer to win7 (start menu). win10 is what win8 should have been. and in reality, there is ways around just about every nit up there. problem is, that if you have to find a way around something in order to get to experience the better things and improvements win8 has to offer then that's a bad thing and deserving of a lot of the hate that win8 has garnered.",csrdlff,1319.1648406060926,1,1435962274,24,8,2191,0,78.17208520179375,1338.0,1788.0,87.0,27,0.08045977011494253,0.0,0.22988505747126436,0.3793103448275862,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.011494252873563218,0.0,0.011494252873563218,0.0,0.0,0.12643678160919541,0.011494252873563218,0.8505747126436781,NaN,0.16292974588938713,0.0,0,0.0,1357,67.30,55.56,30.30,29.47,18.34,12.82,86.37,56.67,13.93,6.41,2.06,0.00,3.24,0.29,0.81,7.52,8.03,14.37,8.70,6.48,6.48,1.03,17.02,4.27,2.06,1.40,1.40,3.24,3.91,2.06,1.84,0.00,0.81,0.22,6.12,0.07,0.00,0.15,0.37,15.40,1.55,1.99,3.83,5.60,1.47,4.79,3.68,2.36,0.74,0.44,0.74,0.15,0.15,0.00,0.44,6.12,0.07,1.40,2.73,2.43,0.66,1.47,13.56,1.11,13.63,1.25,7.52,4.79,1.92,0.52,0.22,0.29,0.00,0.15,1.33,0.07,1.11,0.15,0.00,0.00,15.77,5.75,3.39,0.07,0.00,0.07,0.00,1.03,0.59,0.37,2.80,1.69

t3_333cqy,"you sound very open minded and self aware of your situation. props to you. before anything else, i want to make a few things clear. first, there are several answers to each of your questions. i will use the answer or answers i think are strongest, but you may want to do some additional research if you wish. second, religion is largely faith based. i will warn you that some of the answers will not make much sense someone who is not a believer. hopefully i can do my best to appeal to your situation, but just keep this in mind. > creationism and certain views that contradict plausible science that has been proven again and again. this is an age old question that has been debated for centuries. below are some of the best arguments to answer a question that is incredibly difficult to answer. 1: some christians believe in creation based evolution. long story short, the bible says things were created over the course of days. some christians interpret this as ""periods of time"" instead our normal 24 hour day. there is plenty of debate on this topic, so i encourage you to do some research. in terms of logic, this theory works pretty well. it does not dispute modern science like creation does. it can actually answer some questions that evolution has a hard time with, such as the origin of life. 2. if you do decide to research, do not read anything by ken ham or the traditional creationists. their arguments are made to address a christian audience, not an agnostic one. example: i found this beauty of a quote from a well known creationist website: ""did the flood really happen? yes. jesus said in matt. 24:37-39 that the flood happened. if you can't trust jesus, you can't trust anyone."" be careful with the sources you choose... 3. scientific theories can be false. science can make mistakes, yet it seems like most people overlook this fact. essentially, there is always a possibility of science being wrong, but at the same time, creation can be just as wrong. not a strong argument, but something christians believe in. 4. the general and classic arguments of complexity, origins of life, etc. i do not want to go into depth on these because they are fairly complicated and require some explanation. i would do some research on these issues, but please do not read one article and assume that all christians believe the same thing. > the fact that there is such a harsh distinction between the two possible afterlives: endless punishment or endless paradise, and the fact that someone evil like ted bundy, ""confessed"" and apologized for his sins before execution, would be sent to heaven and a virtuous, amazing human being like bill gates would be sent to hell because he is an atheist. the answer to this will not be very satisfying, let me warn you. ted bundy was on death row for ~10 years. during that time, he reflected on his past decisions. [in the interviews with james dobson,](he seems different. is he doing this to look better in the public eye? is he trying make himself feel better? we do not know. christians believe that god is fair and just. we also believe that god judges everyone for what they do. for terrible, basic example, think of accepting jesus as getting a ticket to a hotel. however, what you did during you life determines the quality of your room. not satisfying, i know. in the same way, bill gates wouldn't get the ticket. an important thing to note about christianity specifically is that it is not a works-based faith. i like to say that christianity is a relationship, not a religion. the goal is to have a personal relationship with jesus, period. this does not excuse your actions because you will still be judges in the end. complicated and unsatisfying, i know. i have been there. > anti-gay, anti-contraception and other repressive movements in the name of religion. i am in the minority of christians who support gay rights. although i do not agree with the idea of homosexuality, i do believe that we should not discriminate based upon gender. like question 1, this question has been tirelessly debated. here is my answer to you. i know several gays who came to our church after several years of being in a relationship with other men. for whatever reason, they came back to the church and are trying to ""become straight"". before i met these guys, my view of gays was pretty harsh. they made me realize the love i feel for women is the same love they feel for men. i can't imagine someone telling me that i can only love men. anyway, these guys all have the same issues: they can't develop close relationships with other males because they might start loving them. they are not attracted to women, so there is a very real chance they may never get married. needless to say, they are all extremely unhappy. what would jesus do? yes, he says that being homosexual is a sin. however, he is fair. my question is this: would jesus want a depressed straight man or a happy homosexual? we do not know. that's how i rationalize it. abortion is simpler to explain, yet harder to answer. i firmly believe that aborting a child is killing it. whether it be alive in the womb or erasing the potential for life, abortion is murder to me. i am not opposed to abortions that stem from rape and domestic abuse. even though i still think it is killing the baby, sometimes killing is permissible. killing out of self defense is an example of this. > various miracles and stories (like noah's ark) in the bible are hard to believe. two responses: first, if you believe in jesus and establish a personal relationship with him, it is easy to believe in his miracles. this argument is obviously towards people who are christian/close to becoming one. response two is specific evidence. it is pretty late, so i can't find the exact article. however, i do know of many atheist/agnostic arguments against the flood. the article i read takes each atheist point and rebuts against it with relative success. if you really want some answers, i would defiantly do some research on your own. despite the onslaught of terrible christian ""evidence"", there are some legitimate articles. > the fact that there are so many religions, and within those, many different denominations and inconsistencies. how can one possible say their belief is the absolute truth, held above the others? out of every argument against christianity and religion in general, this is the most powerful one. there is not a way to answer this with logic or reason. the only answer is to have faith. (warning: i am going to get very preachy, stay with me.) i have tried to refrain from answering your questions with the classic ""god works in mysterious ways"" and ""god can do anything!"". these rebuttals mean nothing to someone who does not believe. this question, however, needs that kind of answer. the only example i can think of comes from the movies. how many people die and sacrifice themselves for someone they love in movies? at a young age, this always confused me. i didn't have an understanding of how powerful love could be. now, being older, i completely understand why certain characters sacrificed themselves in the name of love. the only way i could comprehend their actions was by experiencing it myself. in a similar way, it is not possible for a nonreligious person to understand what a relationship with jesus is like. i am not going to attempt to explain it in depth. just think of it as having some sort of ""experience"" that you somehow, all of the sudden, just know that jesus is there. it sounds dumb, it sounds fake, it sounds ridiculous. i do not disagree. but once you experience it for yourself, you will never forget it. so many religious people, wether catholic, buddhist, muslim, christian, etc, have experiences that are impossible to explain. how can a both muslims and christians see god on their deathbed? how can we know who's right and who's wrong? there is no answer to those questions, aside from actually being in a relationship yourself. i think about your question daily. i wish i had a better answer for you.",cqh6yao,1767.6381564275603,1,1429421668,51,17,4723,0,69.36463059539332,1404.0,2081.0,118.0,3,0.05084745762711865,0.0,0.1440677966101695,0.2288135593220339,0.0,0.0,0.00847457627118644,0.01694915254237288,0.0,0.0,0.00847457627118644,0.00847457627118644,0.00847457627118644,0.0,0.4745762711864406,NaN,0.20512820512820512,0.0,0,0.0,1419,50.58,60.57,52.35,39.64,12.13,21.35,93.09,55.04,15.57,8.39,3.59,0.49,2.18,0.85,1.27,7.19,6.20,12.19,10.71,5.07,4.86,2.47,17.55,5.36,2.54,1.41,1.55,2.47,6.69,3.66,2.89,0.14,1.34,0.14,11.21,0.14,0.14,0.14,1.34,20.79,6.91,2.40,1.83,5.21,1.97,5.00,2.11,0.49,0.70,0.56,1.69,0.14,0.56,0.85,0.00,6.06,1.90,1.55,1.69,0.85,0.85,1.97,13.88,1.06,8.53,0.85,4.44,3.24,1.55,0.35,0.35,0.14,4.02,0.70,0.56,0.14,0.00,0.21,0.14,0.07,17.76,7.75,5.43,0.63,0.00,0.63,0.07,0.28,1.13,0.78,0.35,0.70

t3_3imvlk,"you are lumping three things together that appear to be similar on the surface, but aren't. this is a common mistake to make when you do not understand the causes behind these things. gender dysphoria does exist. it is a recognised medical condition, and it basically means a mismatch between a person's physical sex and their psychological gender. there are valid reasons that this could happen in a person - and it tends to come down to hormones. human development is complex and everything does not always go 100% ""to plan"". we know that there are differences in male and female brains, and that humans start out essentially female in the womb. it is not until hormones are introduced that development progresses toward a particular gender. it could happen that male hormones are introduced 'too late', the brain has started to develop (by default, as a female) before the male hormones are introduced and the rest of the body then develops with male characteristics, thus resulting in a mismatch. there is no mechanism for this to happen in the other two examples you gave - there are no ""wolverine"" hormones, and we certainly do not all start out as starships in the womb - so these things are clearly *very* different conditions caused by completely different things. as far as treatment goes, there are two possible approaches - change the psychological gender to match the body, or the physical sex to match the gender. the first has been attempted but never successful. it is also very ethically questionable to attempt to change a person's psychological identity, which is why no reputable doctor would even consider this approach. therefore the alternative is to change the body. this is done in many ways - usually through hormones and surgery. this has shown to alleviate some of the problems that people with gender dysphoria suffer from, it is not a cure, but it is the best available treatment we have at this time. as you can see, gender dysphoria is not a ""choice"". a trans woman is not a man choosing to become a woman, it is a woman who is undergoing treatment to bring her body more in-line with her identity. you should support and accept a trans person just as much as you would anyone else with a medical condition.",cuhuxz0,284.2316688626999,1,1440710180,56,8,3086,0,53.621212037927734,383.0,601.0,19.0,1,0.05263157894736842,0.10526315789473684,0.15789473684210525,0.7368421052631579,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.0,1.2105263157894735,0.07650949268596327,0.21409921671018275,0.0,0,0.0,386,62.44,64.17,19.33,34.78,20.32,22.02,86.53,57.25,11.92,3.11,0.00,0.78,1.55,0.52,0.26,8.81,9.07,13.21,11.14,5.44,6.74,3.11,16.58,6.48,3.89,1.04,1.30,1.30,2.07,1.30,0.78,0.00,0.00,0.26,9.07,0.00,0.00,2.07,1.30,15.03,2.85,2.85,1.81,1.55,1.81,4.66,0.78,0.52,0.00,0.26,5.96,2.07,3.37,1.04,0.00,3.37,1.04,1.04,0.78,1.04,0.26,1.04,14.25,0.52,10.62,2.33,4.66,3.37,2.33,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,14.25,4.92,3.63,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.55,1.55,1.30,0.52,0.78

t3_35z1es,"i had a really long counterargument, but i lost it all. so i will spare you and give you the short version. it's kind of counter-intuitive to view things like the low cost of exported resources or the low cost of wages as being exploitative of developing countries. those are economic advantages for those countries and allow them to compete globally, even when they may have poor infrastructure, dysfunctional governments, etc. and, ideally, they disappear slowly as a country develops, giving it time to adjust and plan for the future as it is economic situation changes. it's also important to understand that low wages do not mean cheap manufacturing. currency exchange really comes into play here. china is a good example. for a few years a while back, it was artificially deflating its currency to make it more attractive to offshoring. the stronger the renminbi was relative to the dollar, the less cost effective it was to move manufacturing there. after they ended that practice, you saw companies like motorola even move manufacturing back to the us, because high tech, low labor factories in the us were nearly as cost effective as low tech, labor intensive factories in china. the moto x was reported to have cost only an additional $4 a unit to be manufactured in the us. on the flip side, rising costs from developing nations does not make western lifestyles unsustainable. as those countries get wealthier, their middle class grows. a growing middle class means more people who buy western goods. have you ever wondered why gm kept buick around after it is bankruptcy? it sits awkwardly between chevrolet and cadillac. a fully optioned chevy will often cost as much as a comparable but less featured buick and a fully optioned buick starts getting close to cadillac pricing territory. buick is incredibly popular in china. gm will slap a buick badge on a crappy, cheap car from korea and it will outsell anything they offer in the us. so margins may get thinner, because resources and manufacturing get more expensive, but overall revenue increases because the market grows larger. that's not to say that it would be sustainable for *every* country to be on the same economic level as the us. i do not know how well that would work. but a western lifestyle would not be harmed much by bringing the world up to, say, the middle class standards of china.",cr99c3w,98.87425303485564,1,1431638583,232,35,6768,0,56.35758250825083,404.0,637.0,24.0,21,0.041666666666666664,0.0,0.16666666666666666,0.20833333333333334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.0,0.4583333333333333,0.06379007465963987,0.3069306930693069,0.0,0,0.0,405,71.39,57.83,53.21,29.91,16.88,23.95,86.42,49.63,10.62,4.69,0.99,1.23,0.99,0.00,1.48,5.93,8.15,12.59,8.40,5.43,7.65,1.23,15.06,8.40,6.67,0.99,0.25,2.47,4.69,2.47,2.22,0.00,0.25,1.48,5.68,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,11.36,1.73,2.72,0.99,2.72,0.74,3.46,1.23,0.74,0.49,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,8.15,1.23,1.73,4.20,1.48,0.00,2.96,9.38,1.98,16.30,2.47,10.86,3.46,7.41,0.25,0.00,6.42,0.00,0.00,0.49,0.25,0.00,0.00,0.25,0.00,12.59,5.68,4.94,0.00,0.00,0.25,0.00,0.25,0.00,0.74,0.00,0.74

t3_301aim,"roughly a decade ago, i felt *exactly* the same way as you: cosplay that was anything but perfect gave me a sense of extreme revulsion and cringe. why were these awkward looking nerds displaying their social awkwardness and fandom so openly? ugh, they looked so awful and awkward and not at all like what they were dressing up as. it offended my delicate sensibilities so. how did i grow out of this sentiment? couple things: 1. actually going to comic/anime/game conventions and seeing that the vast majority of cosplayers are normal, friendly, socially competent people for their respective age and *respecting* them as such. judge not lest ye be judged: who is the more *socially ungraceful*, someone like them who is having a good time, doing no harm to anyone, or me, judging them because i have some revulsion to their objectively harmless behavior. 2. discovering that cosplay is social and connects you to people rather than isolating yourself. conventions nowadays have tens of thousands of attendees of all ages. i now participate in a cosplay meetup group where every member is a well adjusted adult with a highly skilled full time job and a perfectly nice, sociable human being. we meet out of costume to hang out and discuss what we are reading/watching/playing and to talk about cosplay techniques and we meet up in costume at the conventions we attend. 3. sure not every cosplay is perfect, and yeah some are *pretty bad*, but *who gives a fuck.* not every painting, or book ever written, or every acting performance is a masterpiece either. sure some are not as good as others, but anyone can be a critic. not everyone puts their work and craft out there and improves on it over time to get better. 4. realizing that maybe there was a *little* bit of projection of insecurity going on. again, jnlybj, who is more socially inept, the people who openly express their love for something they like, or me, who does not have the courage to do the same thing and socially connect to people in the context. the sense of weakness you mention is important and i suspect is very similar to what i used to feel. how could people so openly express their nerdiness, which i felt was proxy for **vulnerability.** ""don't they know they are exposing themselves to *ridicule*??"" but no one at these conventions with over 50k attendance mocked them. because the atmosphere at the conventions i have been to is nothing short of *magical*. thousands of people, of all ages, bringing their friends/kids/parents, and getting together to have a good time and show off how much they love the stories, art, characters, games they love. owning it, and expressing yourself and expressing what you love/value regardless of what others might think of you is **not weak**. it is the opposite.",cpo9ccq,271.1487898830427,1,1427142736,31,16,5688,0,62.0385623678647,473.0,717.0,29.0,85,0.034482758620689655,0.0,0.1724137931034483,0.2413793103448276,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034482758620689655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4827586206896552,0.01488095238095238,0.2727272727272727,0.0,0,0.0,484,47.18,83.94,33.17,61.03,17.93,22.52,88.64,54.55,15.70,8.88,2.48,0.83,1.65,0.00,3.93,6.82,5.17,12.81,8.26,4.34,8.68,2.48,14.05,5.37,3.10,3.51,1.45,3.72,8.88,5.17,3.31,0.83,0.83,0.21,17.77,0.21,0.41,0.00,0.00,14.67,2.07,1.45,0.62,3.10,3.31,5.17,2.27,1.24,0.00,0.62,2.07,0.00,0.21,0.21,0.83,10.95,5.17,1.24,3.10,1.86,0.21,3.10,9.71,0.62,9.30,1.65,5.17,2.48,1.45,2.07,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.83,0.21,0.00,0.21,0.41,0.00,19.42,5.37,5.58,0.62,0.00,0.83,0.00,0.00,0.41,0.21,0.00,6.40

t3_327ir6,"okay, let us start off with the very basics of tax theory. a lot of people look at the secondary functions of government, particularly government's role in providing a social safety net, and conclude that the poor benefit from government more than the rich. after all, the poor often directly receive money directly from the government. however, that view fails to consider the primary functions of government such as protecting property rights, maintaining civil order, and preserving the value of currency. when these things are given consideration, it is clear who government benefits the most. compare someone with a 50 million dollar net worth (which includes a giant mansion) to someone making $500 a month from welfare and living in public-assisted housing. if you take away government, the poor person stops getting $500 dollars a month and loses his home. but now there is nothing stopping him from taking the rich guy's mansion...the rich guy who suddenly finds his $50 million has become valueless overnight. both guys are suddenly broke, and whoever lives in the mansion now is basically just who is better at violence. in other words, the more you own in this society, the more you stand to lose if there is no government...while to the very poor, government can actually be a net detriment, imprisoning them, oppressing them, and preventing them from flat-out taking what they want or need. now that we have established that the benefit one receives by keeping society and currency stable is pretty much directly correlated to how much wealth they have, the obvious conclusion is that the more wealth one has, the more tax obligation they should have. just like insurance on a brand-new porsche is more expensive than the insurance on a beat-up 10 year-old kia, government is more valuable to those protecting a $50 million fortune than someone with next to nothing. so in an ideal system, we would tax wealth. however, this has an insurmountable problem - - namely, that it is too difficult and complicated to fairly assess every individual's net worth. this is why we tax income instead. roughly speaking, the amount of income one makes should roughly correspond to the amount of wealth they possess. however, this has problems too. why should someone making $100,000 a year for the first time pay more taxes than someone who owns a $10 million house but is retired and quit earning money? the retiree is still benefiting plenty from a government they have quit paying income tax to. so another solution is to tax physical property, as that is a form of wealth. although physical property does not by any means count for a person's total wealth, it usually is a pretty decent chunk of it. this tax is far from perfect...the poor own very little property, the very rich only a small portion of the wealth is in property, but for the middle class, typically their house represents the vast majority of their net-worth. so in fairness to your position, property taxes disproportionately hits the middle class. to conclude, property taxes are not perfect, but they are likely the closest we are going to get to the ideal tax of taxing wealth. plus, the downside of income tax (it leaves established wealth alone) and the downside of property tax (it leaves wealth in the form of stocks and bonds alone) tend to cancel out. thus, while neither property nor income taxes alone are ideal, the two carried out in conjunction is the closest thing we have to a fair taxation system.",cq8x73f,851.121353276166,1,1428773718,35,11,35571,0,55.684545454545486,583.0,901.0,29.0,11,0.0,0.034482758620689655,0.3103448275862069,0.13793103448275862,0.0,0.034482758620689655,0.0,0.10344827586206896,0.034482758620689655,0.0,0.0,0.10344827586206896,0.10344827586206896,0.034482758620689655,0.8965517241379309,0.12379535147392291,0.2469982847341338,0.0,0,0.0,601,82.07,69.71,11.55,72.50,23.12,22.63,87.19,50.25,9.98,3.99,0.00,1.00,0.67,0.50,1.83,5.99,9.65,12.65,7.15,6.16,5.49,1.16,11.81,8.32,3.99,1.83,3.00,3.66,7.82,5.16,2.66,0.00,0.00,1.16,8.32,0.00,0.50,0.00,1.00,13.48,1.83,1.33,2.16,3.16,2.33,3.66,0.67,0.50,0.17,0.00,0.67,0.00,0.67,0.00,0.00,12.15,1.16,2.16,5.82,2.16,2.00,0.50,9.48,0.17,10.98,1.00,5.82,4.33,7.15,0.00,0.67,9.32,0.00,0.00,0.17,0.00,0.00,0.17,0.00,0.00,15.81,5.66,5.99,0.00,0.00,0.17,0.00,1.33,0.00,0.67,1.00,1.00

t3_327ir6,"i agree that taxes on structures are a bad idea, but taxes on *land* is something i can really get behind. the reason is because ""property ownership"" is a state creation. who owns a piece of land? the real answer is whoever can trace back superior chain of title to the original owner, the state. and part of this maintenance of chain of title and the rules for what happens when an owner sells a piece of land to buyer1, and then turns around, without mentioning that he has already sold the land, sells it again to buyer2, and they both show up trying to build a house on it, what happens then? well, what happens is the court system figures out who owns that land. and there are tons of issues that come up in land ownership recording (every county has a deed recorder's office), from how ownership is split up (things can get complicated when conditions get attached to ownership, or where covenants, servitudes, or easements burden the land). and in the end, because land is finite, we want it to go to the most productive use of that land. property tax is a simple mechanism for allowing land to revert to the highest bidder (and the highest bidder will generally be the person who can make most productive use of it), and it is inherently much more fair than [adverse possession]((where a squatter eventually obtains the right to keep the land). property is not real. it is a creation of the state, and we expect the state to protect our interests in our property. if roving bandits kick us off our land, we expect the state to help us regain possession. we also expect the state to determine who the real owner is when there is any dispute. it seems fair that the state gets to tax that value in order to provide that function.",cq8yiha,473.48167629191147,1,1428776270,35,11,38123,0,64.3290566037736,318.0,449.0,14.0,5,0.14285714285714285,0.0,0.07142857142857142,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07142857142857142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14285714285714285,0.0,0.9285714285714286,0.1239136931444624,0.2578616352201258,0.0,0,0.0,319,79.87,76.45,37.71,72.70,22.79,16.93,85.27,53.61,12.23,4.08,0.63,2.82,0.00,0.31,0.31,8.15,9.72,13.79,7.21,5.33,6.90,0.63,13.17,3.45,1.88,4.39,0.00,3.45,4.39,3.45,0.94,0.00,0.00,0.00,8.46,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.31,11.91,2.19,3.76,1.57,3.13,0.31,2.82,0.31,0.31,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,11.29,3.13,1.25,5.33,1.57,0.63,0.63,13.79,2.19,15.36,0.94,11.29,3.13,2.19,0.31,0.31,2.82,0.00,0.00,0.63,0.00,0.00,0.31,0.31,0.00,14.73,3.76,5.33,0.00,0.00,0.63,0.00,0.00,0.63,0.31,2.82,1.25

t3_37zdvz,"have they been proposing to replace criminal law with torts, or regulatory law with torts? for the most part, i have seen proposals for regulatory law to be reduced, with more effective causes of action and procedure (especially for class actions) to be put in their stead. the advantages of torts in these cases are threefold: * **lawsuits require a determination of damages.** so for many regulations there is a very vague sense about who might be harmed by the thing being regulated. in many cases, such regulations prohibit things that are not very harmful at all. in other cases, they add extremely burdensome hoops to jump through to do certain things. highly restrictive zoning laws are an example of this. in my area, there is basically no land which is zoned for multiunit housing. if you want to build an apartment structure, you need to get a variance from the town. and if you want a variance, you would better donate to the right official's campaigns, and use the right overpriced subcontractors. all of this is done to ""protect the property values"" of the neighbors. if there were no regulations on this, and instead a cause of action for materially and adversely impacting property via construction nuisance, the developer could be forced to pay for any actual damage to property owners nearby, but would not be forced to go through the hoops and corruption that come from current regulations. basically, if you can't show the rule actually harms someone, it should not be a rule. using tort law requires that harm be shown. * **the common law is awesome at developing effective rules.** in the english common law system and those derived from it, the rules surrounding agreements, damages, and sundry other disputes have been honed over centuries. the common law system for dealing with contracts is highly detailed and really quite excellent. by developing the law in a case-by-case manner over a long time, we have honed a really precise tool, far more precise than could be done through a legislative or regulatory process. * **adversarial systems prevent cozy regulation and corruption.** in many cases, regulators do a really crappy job of regulation because their employees want to get jobs in the industry the regulate, or are friends with people in industry, or because their elected bosses like the industry. the sec is notorious for this, and is basically a paper tiger when it comes to regulating major financial institutions. when you have private causes of action for securities misdealings, the party on the other side of the case has every reason to zealously bring the case. they will not drop it for political reasons.",crr56rp,430.29514935446844,1,1433108473,54,6,-16416,0,49.86135722679202,444.0,721.0,23.0,141,0.0,0.0,0.08695652173913043,0.30434782608695654,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.043478260869565216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5217391304347826,0.12312132312132312,0.2725225225225225,0.0,0,0.0,446,86.69,45.53,14.20,22.30,22.30,24.22,84.53,52.47,8.30,3.36,0.45,0.22,1.35,0.00,1.35,4.93,8.52,15.70,9.19,4.48,5.61,1.57,13.00,3.14,1.35,0.90,0.00,2.69,4.71,2.24,2.47,0.00,0.22,0.00,4.71,0.00,0.45,0.00,0.00,13.90,1.35,3.14,2.91,3.14,1.79,5.16,0.67,0.45,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,11.88,1.12,0.90,8.52,1.12,0.67,1.57,10.09,0.45,10.54,2.69,6.05,1.12,9.64,0.22,0.67,0.67,0.00,0.00,0.45,0.22,0.00,0.22,0.00,0.00,15.92,4.93,5.38,0.22,0.00,0.22,0.00,0.45,0.45,0.45,0.45,3.36

t3_3dgzr8,"the national manual on uniform traffic control deals with this issue, and allows for local governments to put a stop or yield sign at crossings that have two or more trains per day. it also gets into why the government should be able to put a yield or stop sign, as opposed to just the [normal railroad crossing sign](>r15-1) sign for all highway approaches to railroad grade crossings. it also allows the optional use of yield or stop signs at passive crossings. while the crossbuck sign is in fact a regulatory sign that requires vehicles to yield to trains and stop if necessary, recent research indicates insufficient road user understanding of and compliance with that regulatory requirement when just the crossbuck sign is present at passive crossings. therefore, the fhwa encourages consideration of the use of yield or stop signs in conjunction with the crossbuck sign at all passive crossings except where train crews always provide flagging to roadway users. basically, because research has shown people basically ignore the railroad sign and just driven through without looking. so if it is in a spot where there is at least two trains going through a day, they put a yield or stop sign because people actually recognize those signs and will use caution. as far as why a stop sign as opposed to yield, it looks like the states will decide that. in [texas](they factor in how fast the train will be moving, what type of traffic will be crossing (buses, hazardous materials carriers, large equipment), how frequent a train comes, whether the rail lie is used by passenger trains or transporting hazardous material, etc. basically, in the areas where there is more people crossing or involvement of hazardous materials, states will go a little extra to try to prevent an accident. no one wants a car getting hit by a train, but you *really* do not want a train carrying some hazardous material getting hit.",ct5cwg7,605.576076037894,1,1437060022,16,5,33627,0,49.8162097902098,325.0,488.0,11.0,6,0.18181818181818182,0.09090909090909091,0.09090909090909091,0.9090909090909091,0.0,0.0,0.09090909090909091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09090909090909091,0.0,1.4545454545454544,0.26085847159376574,0.24307692307692308,0.0,0,0.0,328,87.24,38.00,50.24,10.40,29.82,24.70,77.74,45.12,4.27,0.91,0.00,0.00,0.30,0.00,0.61,3.35,8.23,13.72,5.49,6.71,9.15,0.91,12.50,4.57,2.74,3.05,1.22,2.13,1.83,0.30,1.52,0.00,0.00,0.00,2.74,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,14.63,1.22,4.88,1.52,3.96,1.52,5.18,0.61,0.61,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,12.80,0.30,0.91,4.27,1.22,6.10,0.30,7.93,2.13,16.16,4.27,7.32,4.88,2.74,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,12.20,3.35,4.88,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.30,0.00,0.00,1.52,2.13

t3_31kfkt,"i will not try to change your view that ones right to decide her fate extends to her choice to commit suicide. why? because it is absolutely correct. with this i am not implying that it is necessarily a good idea for you to commit a suicide, but merely pointing out that you are absolutely *completely* free to act in whatever way you wish in any given scenario. there might be laws, social conventions and consequences, but when it comes to the act itself it is you - and no-one else - who decides. despite this, i do want to say some things about your seeming view that suicide is a favorable option. keeping in mind what i said above, forget all the arguments you have heard which state that ""you should not commit suicide because of the pain you will cause to *others*"". although being the argument you most commonly hear, it is a poor one and is not very convincing. while someone who uses this argument thinks she has convincing you that it would be a selfish act to commit suicide she ultimately reveals her own selfishness. she want's you to continue living for *her*, because *she* does not want to feel pain. and anyways - you and i, and anybody who dares to be honest to herself, know that if we were to commit suicide, none of the consequences are going to matter for us. there will not be any regret or angst on our part after dying. the reason i talk about this particular argument is to make the following clear: do not fall into the trap of thinking that you are living for anyone else than yourself! it is crucial to realize that you do, and you should, live and act the way you do for *yourself*. when you have done that, you can first start to think of reasons to continue living - reasons that are on your terms. so my advice to you is this: sit down tonight and think long and hard about the things that make life worth living for *you*. think about the meaning you can create for your life (because it sure didn't just come along when you were thrown into this world) and list the things that you enjoy about living. doing this is the only way you can rationally decide if it pays off for you to continue living. to add to this, i would like to point out that we do not really have to reinvent the wheel. philosophers have been trying for centuries to figure out if they should kill themselves, and some of them have come up with quite convincing arguments. if you are interested and patient, which you probably are (as you wan't to make an educated decision), i recommend reading up on some philosophy. for example: * albert camus (who famously held that ""there is but one truly serious philosophical problem: suicide"") - [*the stranger*](* william james' short essay - [*is life worth living?*](* in any case, the whole doctrine of [*existentialism*](would probably interest you.",cq2m1cu,734.4453946971552,1,1428319347,145,32,15297,0,65.12871541501976,506.0,714.0,23.0,1,0.0,0.0,0.13043478260869565,0.30434782608695654,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.0,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.043478260869565216,0.5652173913043478,NaN,0.2075098814229249,0.0,0,0.0,508,32.72,89.60,19.07,14.82,23.09,16.93,92.13,62.01,21.06,11.61,1.77,0.79,6.69,1.77,0.59,9.45,4.33,14.37,10.83,5.12,6.30,2.17,19.09,2.36,0.98,2.36,0.79,2.36,4.72,1.97,2.76,0.00,1.18,0.20,13.78,0.00,0.00,1.77,0.00,20.87,4.92,3.74,2.95,4.53,2.76,4.72,2.36,0.79,0.79,0.79,2.56,0.00,2.56,0.00,0.00,4.33,0.98,0.79,1.38,0.59,0.59,1.97,14.57,1.57,9.06,1.57,5.12,2.36,0.39,0.00,0.00,0.98,0.00,1.77,0.59,0.00,0.00,0.39,0.00,0.20,18.90,3.94,3.54,0.79,0.00,0.39,0.20,1.38,0.79,0.79,1.77,5.31

t3_346hwk,">when i watch the video, i see a mother that has lost control of her anger and takes it out on her son. the son is not being taught why his behavior was wrong; he has being taught the consequences of an angry mother. that is correct, for the seconds of video in which she has removing him from the riot. you have no idea whether she was explaining *why* it was wrong when they got home. in a middle of a riot is probably not the easiest/best time to launch into a full discussion on that. >the examples of good parents are the ones who's children were not rioting, destroying property, looting, or hurting others. probably true in most cases. but kids still do fucking dumb things, especially teenagers. they are assholes. they are surrounded by assholes who convince them to do asshole things, even ones that were brought up by good parents. taking a role in social movements is a complex thing. a teenager is trying to be a part of something that his friends and peers of similar race/socioeconomic status tell him is making a positive difference and lashing back at the injustice they feel. they could not be more wrong, but his failure to see that at this stage of his life does not necessarily reflect poor parenting. edit: also, your debate fails a bit here in that you do not regard what will happen after the video as part of the overall consideration of parenting, but you do wish to consider what you assume has happened before the footage. can't have it both ways. as for your third paragraph, that's entirely the issue of ""do good parents spank their children or not?"" that's something that's been debated to death and is a larger discussion than just this video. i do not think her outlash in grabbing/striking him makes her a bad parent in and of itself. >the type of parenting that keeps kids out of riots is one where you are involved with your children, provide structure, are consistent, and teach them right from wrong. and if her ability to provide structure and involvement was impacted by the fact that she worked 70 hours a week to provide a better opportunity for her children at the expense of spending more time with them, would we consider this issue the same way? could her best efforts to teach right from wrong still be undermined by a community he grows up in, where people doing things the ""wrong"" way leads to more success, like a drug dealer having the nicest car in the neighborhood? does his outcome solely reflect parenting and nothing else? >you can't mold a mind by hitting a head. you seem hung up on this as the only parenting tactic involved in this situation. with all of that said, you frame your argument on this point: >i would not consider the angry mother to be a bad parent, but her actions should not be heralded as if she were a model parent. so you are challenge for us to change your view that she has not a model parent? i can try, but i am not going to be able to confirm/reject her parenting skills based on this video alone. using only the information we have in front of us, the question is, what would the model parent do in this situation? if your only response is ""a model parent wouldn't be in this situation"" then i can't change your view, because i can't reflect upon her parenting without pure speculation. to answer that question, in my mind a model parent would go into a riot, drag her child from it using the techniques that will be effective at that moment in time - including shaming his behavior in front of his peers, and striking him if necessary to reinforce the seriousness of the situation. she would sacrifice her own embarrassment by taking accountability of her child and ending his poor behavior as soon as possible. he has a male teenager, he can withstand the physical force if it allows his mother to be heard and her concerns for his behavior to be better understood.",cqrpyt7,1228.504585878243,1,1430249949,114,20,-23537,0,63.633550831545094,699.0,1000.0,32.0,1,0.03125,0.0,0.21875,0.15625,0.0,0.03125,0.0,0.0625,0.0,0.0,0.03125,0.03125,0.09375,0.0,0.65625,0.06267734340739434,0.23605150214592274,0.0,0,0.0,704,61.32,86.92,8.93,5.01,22.00,18.61,90.77,58.66,17.19,10.80,1.28,0.57,2.27,5.40,1.28,6.39,7.81,14.35,10.37,2.98,5.26,2.84,15.48,6.11,3.55,1.85,0.43,1.42,5.97,1.99,3.98,0.14,1.42,0.85,18.04,3.27,0.28,3.41,2.98,14.63,2.98,2.70,2.13,2.84,1.56,4.83,2.13,1.42,0.28,0.43,1.14,0.57,0.43,0.14,0.00,12.22,3.55,2.56,4.26,1.99,1.70,2.56,10.51,0.85,11.36,2.13,6.96,2.41,1.85,0.71,0.28,0.71,0.14,0.14,0.71,0.71,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,12.64,3.69,3.84,0.28,0.14,0.85,0.00,0.14,0.85,1.28,0.00,1.56

t3_369z6x,"there is plenty to address but i can address why it is unsafe for cyclists to ride on the sidewalks: * visibility when exiting driveways, entering intersections and other places that cross sidewalks is way more limited than when a car enters a roadway. drivers are not expecting someone traveling 12-21 mph on the sidewalk and now they could be traveling from either direction making it a tricky situation for both parties. cyclists are far more visible when riding on the road than they are on sidewalks. * sidewalks are generally done in paved sections, narrow and do not always follow a consistent pathway. this now makes it difficult to both cyclists and pedestrians to use the walkway. many times the sidewalks are uneven making it hazardous. ultimately, i find that bikes are moving closer to automobile speeds (except for children who i believe are allowed to ride on the sidewalk) then they are walking speeds. if you are riding a bike for sport i am not sure why you would possibly promote riding on sidewalks unless for some reason your town has very nice, even sidewalks with no blind drives. i ride my bike for sport, commuting and errands and it would be impossible for pedestrians and cyclists to use the sidewalk and would stifle any movement toward alternative transportation. making cycling safer will take more cars off the road which is a good thing (health- and environmental-wise). what you are seeing seems more like a poorly implemented cycling infrastructure since you say no one is using it. i am a bit spoiled since i bike in boston which is one of the top bike friendly cities and most of that is attributed to the very intense and meticulous planning done by menino's organization (and all of the research institutions around here help tons). i have read that removing a car lane (sometimes) eases congestion but i am on a phone and can't find it right now. my parting words are that the attitude of ""roads are for automobiles"" is one that needs to change (i doubt i did that with this post) but once we accept the fact that bikes, cars, trucks, buses, can all occupy the same space we can more effectively integrate them all.",crc2yk9,255.17629880874202,1,1431887574,54,15,1795,0,50.37870000000001,375.0,573.0,14.0,1,0.0,0.0,0.2857142857142857,0.21428571428571427,0.0,0.0,0.07142857142857142,0.0,0.07142857142857142,0.0,0.0,0.07142857142857142,0.07142857142857142,0.0,0.7857142857142856,0.09505151711034063,0.288,0.0,0,0.0,378,60.80,41.63,78.14,34.98,27.00,20.63,86.24,51.32,12.70,6.35,3.44,0.53,1.32,0.00,1.06,6.35,6.35,11.64,10.32,4.23,5.82,1.59,16.67,5.56,3.70,2.38,1.59,4.76,3.97,2.12,1.59,0.26,0.26,0.00,5.03,0.00,0.26,0.00,0.00,15.61,2.38,4.23,2.12,2.65,1.59,3.97,1.32,0.79,0.53,0.00,0.79,0.00,0.79,0.00,0.00,5.29,1.32,1.06,1.59,0.79,1.32,0.79,12.70,1.06,17.99,5.56,8.20,3.97,1.85,2.91,0.79,0.26,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,11.38,3.70,2.38,0.26,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.79,0.53,0.53,2.65,0.53

(yes, some people still do this). are you proposing they put their horse and buggy on a sidewalk? in my area, outside of town there are no sidewalks. who will pay for installation of sidewalks or whatever alongside *every* roadway? bikes are allowed to go in and out of towns, you know. what do they do when the sidewalk ends? in major cities during peak times, sidewalks can be packed shoulder to shoulder with pedestrians walking. in order for a bicycle to not tip over, it has to keep moving forward. it is impossible to move fast enough to keep the bike upright if you are trapped in a throng of slow walking pedestrians. how do you solve this? if you are arguing nobody is allowed on roads other than cars, where do you propose pedestrians are permitted to go when there is not a sidewalk? are you banning people from walking places where sidewalks do not exist? for all the residents of cities that do not own or rely on cars in any way, will you be giving them a big tax refund? their money helped pay for the public roadway. now you are banning them from using it, so it seems only logical they get a tax break. to offset it, are you willing to install lots of toll booths at the end of every road so that only motorists pay for roads? do you feel the hassle of paying 20 tolls on your way home from work is worth it in order to get bicycles off ""your"" roadway?",crc5ame,957.4090717791408,1,1431917288,54,15,31509,0,72.40364271457086,668.0,934.0,42.0,19,0.0,0.0,0.07142857142857142,0.30952380952380953,0.0,0.0,0.07142857142857142,0.0,0.023809523809523808,0.023809523809523808,0.0,0.023809523809523808,0.0,0.0,0.5238095238095238,0.11939246390465903,0.20209580838323354,0.0,0,0.0,678,73.63,45.88,71.10,36.11,16.14,15.04,85.40,52.36,10.32,5.46,1.47,0.00,2.06,0.00,1.92,4.87,6.05,15.49,8.55,5.60,5.31,3.39,15.34,3.10,1.77,1.47,1.03,3.10,1.92,1.18,0.59,0.00,0.15,0.00,7.08,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,12.83,1.33,1.92,2.06,3.39,1.47,5.31,0.44,0.15,0.00,0.29,1.33,1.03,0.29,0.00,0.00,5.46,0.29,1.03,1.92,1.62,0.74,1.62,11.80,0.29,18.29,4.42,11.06,3.39,2.65,3.54,0.29,1.92,0.29,0.00,0.29,0.00,0.00,0.15,0.15,0.00,15.19,4.72,5.16,0.15,0.00,1.47,0.00,0.59,0.29,0.29,0.88,1.62

t3_34m77r,"you specifically asked about the suspicious stock trading. there's an excellent summary of the information investigated by the sec and fbi following 9/11, when they both looked into the suspicous trades, [here](it is a long read so i am going to pull out some of the highlights: >the amr put trading on september 10 further reveals how trading that looks highly suspicious at first blush can prove innocuous. the put volume of amr on september 10 was unusually high and actually exceeded the call volume by a ratio of 6:1?again, highly suspicious on its face. the sec traced much of the surge in volume to a california investment advice newsletter, distributed by email and fax on sunday, september 9, which advised its subscribers to purchase a particular type of amr put options. the sec interviewed 28 individuals who purchased these types of amr puts on september 10, and found that 26 of them cited the newsletter as the reason for their transaction. another 27 purchasers were listed as subscribers of the newsletter. the sec interviewed the author of the newsletter, a u.s. citizen, who explained his investment strategy analysis, which had nothing to do with foreknowledge of 9/11. other put option volume on september 10 was traced to similarly innocuous trades. >another good example concerns a suspicious ual put trade on september 7, 2001. a single trader bought more than one-third of the total puts purchased that day, establishing a position that proved very profitable after 9/11. moreover, it turns out that the same trader had a short position in ual calls?another strategy that would pay off if the price of ual dropped. investigation, however, identified the purchaser as a well-established new york hedge fund with $2 billion under management. setting aside the unlikelihood of al qaeda having a relationship with a major new york hedge fund, these trades looked facially suspicious. but further examination showed the fund also owned 29,000 shares of ual stock at the time?all part of a complex, computer-driven trading strategy. as a result of these transactions, the fund actually lost $85,000 in value when the market reopened. had the hedge fund wanted to profit from the attacks, it would not have retained the ual shares. >the fbi investigated a trader who bought a substantial position in put options in aig insurance co. shortly before 9/11. viewed in isolation, the trade looked highly suspicious, especially when aig stock plummeted after 9/11. the fbi found that the trade had been made by a fund manager to hedge a long position of 4.2 million shares in the aig common stock. the fund manager owned a significant amount of aig stock, but the fund had a very low tax basis in the stock (that is, it had been bought long ago and had appreciated significantly over time). selling even some of it would have created a massive tax liability. thus, the fund manager chose to hedge his position through a put option purchase. after 9/11, the fund profited substantially from its investment in puts. at the same time, however, it suffered a substantial loss on the common stock, and overall lost money as a result of the attacks. when you just look at the fact that there were way more put options, it sounds very suspicious. so that's all ""truthers"" mention. when you go a little deeper, and look at each of the individual companies and individuals who made those trades, as the sec did, you see that there is a reasonable, completely non-conspiracy reason those trades happened. a conspiracy theorist will tell you ""well the sec was in on it"". and in isolation, maybe that could be true. but they have to say that over and over, about a growing number of people, organizations, and groups. when your list of conspirators grows to thousands and thousands of individuals, it does not make sense. when you consider the scale of 9/11 - 1000's killed, buildings destroyed, a significant change to our countries' mindset and even culture, you will find coincidences. but when you fully investigate those coincidences, you do not find a conspiracy.",cqw2c9f,843.7675907241912,1,1430608100,505,45,10284,0,51.55116477504694,662.0,1073.0,37.0,3,0.10810810810810811,0.08108108108108109,0.21621621621621623,0.21621621621621623,0.0,0.02702702702702703,0.0,0.05405405405405406,0.02702702702702703,0.0,0.05405405405405406,0.02702702702702703,0.05405405405405406,0.0,0.864864864864865,0.08240819852661958,0.24471299093655588,0.0,0,0.0,702,92.41,70.11,38.39,17.49,20.65,22.08,80.91,46.01,8.40,2.56,0.14,0.14,1.42,0.28,0.57,5.84,11.11,13.39,5.13,5.41,5.41,0.57,12.54,4.27,2.85,2.14,5.84,2.42,4.84,2.14,2.71,1.00,0.57,1.00,6.41,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.28,10.97,3.70,1.85,1.00,1.71,1.71,1.99,1.71,1.28,0.28,0.00,0.28,0.28,0.00,0.00,0.00,4.99,0.85,1.42,1.99,0.57,0.28,5.13,4.56,0.43,14.67,2.71,7.69,3.99,7.12,0.00,0.00,7.69,0.00,0.14,0.28,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.28,0.00,15.95,5.13,6.27,0.28,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.71,0.57,0.57,0.43,1.99

t3_3geljg,"freedom of speech is an inalienable human right from a philosophical perspective (not just something from the constitution). think about it this way: if someone told you that you could not speak your mind on something, you would be pissed, so do not impose that restriction on someone else. however, that example is not specific enough for your question. you are wondering, what if what someone is saying is dangerous in and of itself. here's an extreme example: i want to tell the world about my opinion that all black people have a genetic predisposition to being criminals, that jews have a genetic predisposition to be misers, and that mexicans have a genetic predisposition to be lazy. all three of those sentences not only have no factual backing, but can cause serious harm to society (what if someone were to buy into those stereotypes and act upon them (some people do, and you can see the damage it can cause)). in this case, the westboro baptist church claims to have a message to the world, and a plea to hold the belief that homosexuality is an active danger to society. they approve of ostracizing a group of individuals based on their genetic disposition (and even if you do not believe that, and think it is a choice, the westboro church has done nothing to prove that homosexuality is a danger to society). inherently, they are behaving immorally, because they cannot prove to our society that their extreme claims are true. the main issue with the wbc's claims is that they target a group of people who come from a variety of cultural and ethnic backgrounds. it is not a small group or a single person where it might be conceivable to hold the notion that they deserve to be ostracized. (perhaps you think you have sufficient evidence to dislike a police officer accused of murder, with a history of violence; or maybe a small club of people with a history of racism and prejudice like the ku klux klan). when all is said and done, the wbc attacks a broad group of people without grounds to prove they are being a menace, which is what they claim. you can conclude that members of the wbc are either **ignorant about their cause**, or **actively bullying or attacking their intended targets**.",ctxg7g3,226.55549223610302,1,1439171843,39,11,2737,0,53.36360539845762,389.0,576.0,14.0,3,0.0,0.0,0.14285714285714285,0.21428571428571427,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07142857142857142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4285714285714285,0.06905163549900392,0.2596401028277635,0.0,0,0.0,389,58.53,78.73,10.18,1.49,27.79,21.34,86.12,58.61,15.68,6.68,0.51,0.26,2.83,0.00,3.08,9.00,9.00,12.60,11.31,3.34,5.91,2.83,14.40,3.34,0.77,2.06,0.51,2.83,5.66,1.29,4.37,0.26,1.29,0.26,13.88,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,15.94,3.60,1.54,1.80,5.40,2.57,5.40,1.54,0.51,1.03,0.00,0.77,0.26,0.00,0.51,0.00,5.91,2.57,0.26,2.31,0.00,0.77,1.29,12.08,0.26,5.66,0.26,4.63,0.77,0.26,0.26,0.00,0.26,1.54,0.26,0.26,0.26,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,14.14,3.60,4.63,0.51,0.26,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.51,2.57,2.06

t3_3dbole,"others have already said a lot about this, so i will leave you with [this](a really, really good post on why ""egalitarianism"" has come to be at odds with feminism and why feminism embodies the ideals of egalitarianism way, way better than egalitarianism does. it's also worth pointing out that the ""feminazis"" (god, i hate that term) often have something resembling a point. i am no fan of the gawker-network callout culture that's become somewhat of a normalized force in internet discussions today, but i think that most of the internet's disdain of feminism comes from a caricatural portrayal brought about by cherry-picking examples of poorly-manifested attempts at feminism. i think it is valuable, next time you see a ""feminazi"" post, to look carefully at the source material and realize that, however acerbic or acidic the post might be, the author's coming from a legitimate place of pain much of the time, a place which unfortunately informs the tone of the piece. feminism as a movement is great. it tackles head-on many uncomfortable questions about inequality between genders that are reinforced thanks to vicious cycles and socialization, and if people who are benefiting from that inequality (myself included) are angry that people are calling them to think more critically about the advantages they have been handed, then so be it. i think there are some people who get turned off by the overwhelming minority of people who embody the movement poorly, but i think that more people get turned off by other men who already have a disdain for the movement - a disdain that will not be changed easily, especially by re-terming the movement. i think that, in the end, there is a quote i will paraphrase that i can't remember off the top of my head that describes the need for the term to stick around: in any article discussing feminism, the vitriol of the comments section validates the movement's need to exist. it is got power under its current name, even if many people wouldn't like to admit it, and as long as it continues to gather steam there is no reason to change it to another name dominated, as the rugnetta post shows, by straight white men.",ct3p6ns,322.74902712029257,1,1436929944,129,21,-20285,0,29.518573573573576,370.0,593.0,9.0,9,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7777777777777778,0.0,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2222222222222222,0.0,1.666666666666667,0.03869047619047619,0.28378378378378377,0.0,0,0.0,376,80.40,46.81,67.18,21.68,41.78,23.14,85.11,53.72,13.03,4.26,3.19,0.00,0.53,0.00,0.53,8.78,9.31,15.43,7.98,5.85,5.05,1.33,15.96,4.26,2.66,1.86,0.00,3.99,5.05,2.39,2.66,0.53,1.06,0.27,7.18,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.53,12.77,3.46,2.13,1.60,3.19,0.27,3.99,1.86,1.06,0.27,0.27,0.80,0.53,0.27,0.00,0.00,4.79,0.27,1.33,2.13,1.86,0.27,2.93,13.03,1.60,14.63,3.72,6.12,3.72,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.80,0.27,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,15.43,2.39,5.59,0.27,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.60,1.60,2.13,1.33,0.53

t3_3cqwqj,"context: i am a staff writer for a few music websites (including sputnik! i am brostep there), and i work a lot with electronic music. there are two major arguments i see against being very specific with genres: 1. not all genres are, for lack of a better word, legitimate. there are certain genres, like the ones you have listed, which are generally agreed upon - i do not think there are many people who would argue that ""mathcore"" is not legitimate. that said, there are other genres which are invoked very often, even though many, many people have argued compellingly that their very existence is kind of stupid. take the whole dubstep sub-branching, for example. ""dubstep"" is generally considered to be a legit genre - it is got quite a nice foundation in the london music scene, and people have been using it properly for a while. same arguably goes for ""brostep"" (hence my username, though it is admittedly a touch tongue-in-cheek), which has been codified by enough well-established music blogs to have its existence justified. however, the dozens of other ""-step"" genres are the kinds of genres i would argue are not good at all. people who bandy about the terms ""chillstep,"" ""liquid dubstep,"" or ""trapstep"" (or, as we have seen in a few very public examples on /r/electronicmusic, ""flumestep"" or ""feelstep"") are typically not the kind of people who have the scene-wide knowledge or experience to codify new genres of music, although they will inevitably spread the word regardless. thus, even though there is nothing really new being done (for example, clubroot, submotion orchestra, and phaeleh have all been doing what is called ""chillstep"" for years before that term was ever brought up), new, completely unnecessary genres are made up. 2. genres can be very terrifying for newbies. i know that dev was pretty merciless when i started writing for sput, especially since i would been inoculated with these genres that people who'd been in the scene for more than a year or two didn't use for fairly obvious reasons, and i am surprised i didn't stop trying to delve into electronic music then and there. there are a lot of people like me out there, too. if we are sticklers about excessive genrefication - for example, if someone tries to call a song ""drumstep"" and people berate him because it is really more just half-time drum & bass - that'll scare away the people new to the general style (whether metal or electronic), meaning that a potential opportunity to find a lot of really, really cool music has been totally lost. i am sure you have seen this in comment threads, where someone will jump in and proclaim his love for whatever the new metal subgenre du jour is and other users will jump all over him for being inexperienced, and he has leave the site forever. if we are sticklers about genres, we will lose a lot of potential listeners. so, to reiterate: genres can be good. however, not all genres are good, and not all enforcing of genres is good. ""disdain of genres"" in general is one thing (though i think you would be hard-pressed to find anyone of serious musical experience who just wants to call everything ""metal""), disdain of nonexistent genres (not mathcore, per se, but things like moombahcore and moombahstep) is another. and, of course, if we are too zealous in enforcing these genres (for example, if a user were to yell at someone for calling ttng rock instead of math rock), we risk the destruction of a potential fanbase.",csy6eer,757.1174570834974,1,1436500156,19,5,4562,0,53.09525558166864,592.0,893.0,23.0,9,0.043478260869565216,0.08695652173913043,0.17391304347826086,0.8260869565217391,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.0,0.08695652173913043,0.08695652173913043,0.17391304347826086,0.0,0.0,0.08695652173913043,0.0,1.608695652173913,0.12206476183748909,0.2483108108108108,0.0,0,0.0,600,45.27,43.37,21.01,31.45,26.09,20.00,81.67,55.17,11.17,5.00,2.50,1.00,0.50,0.67,0.33,6.17,5.33,12.50,12.67,8.00,6.33,1.83,17.50,4.33,1.67,2.17,1.17,3.17,5.00,2.67,2.33,0.50,1.33,0.33,8.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.67,17.50,1.67,1.67,2.00,5.33,3.00,6.83,3.83,0.50,2.17,0.67,0.50,0.33,0.00,0.00,0.00,5.33,1.17,1.67,1.00,1.33,0.67,3.67,11.33,1.67,7.83,1.00,3.67,3.17,1.50,2.33,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.50,0.00,0.17,0.17,0.17,0.00,21.67,3.67,7.17,0.50,0.00,0.00,0.17,2.00,4.33,0.67,2.67,0.50

(1) entertainment. you can join a club to watch endless broadway plays and productions for *dirt cheap*. some of the finest museums on the planet are here. (2) there is business on top of business in nyc. if you are an entrepreneur, you can't walk down the street without finding some opportunity or another. (3) if you want to do yoga or martial arts or stuntman training or anything else you can possibly think of, there are more options for each one than anywhere else. (4) restaurants. new ones spring up *all of the time*. also partially motivated by the cost of operation, bad ones die quickly. it is survival of the fittest. do you want a cheeseburger at 5:00 am? no problem. do you want authentic nigerian food? done. how about world class, award winning bbq? yep. (5) diversity. you can meet people from any part of the world, just about everywhere you go. (6) dating/nightlife. there are more events to visit than there will be nights in your life. there are more people, opportunities and events centered around dating than anywhere else i can think of. (7) careers. nyc costs more, and if you are not doing at least *ok* financially then it hurts. but assuming that you have a college education, the jobs here pay a lot more than the jobs elsewhere. (8) politics. we have and proactive political centers. everything from protests to celebrations. (9) education. we have excellent ~~schools~~ *universities*. honestly i could go on forever, but nyc has a lot of great traits. if a person does not make use of the resources available, then they are probably better off in a place where they do not have to pay as much to live there. but for those interested, nyc has a lot of things that are just not available in many other places including boston.",ct47mit,706.394441330734,1,1436977245,327,54,2419,0,73.89540540540543,376.0,545.0,37.0,32,0.05405405405405406,0.02702702702702703,0.10810810810810811,0.7297297297297297,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02702702702702703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08108108108108109,0.0,1.027027027027027,0.013657407407407408,0.2765957446808511,0.0,0,0.0,388,60.56,62.16,32.64,77.86,10.49,17.53,89.18,53.35,9.79,6.19,1.29,0.52,3.87,0.00,0.52,3.61,5.67,14.18,9.79,8.25,6.96,1.80,14.43,5.67,4.12,0.77,3.35,5.67,5.93,4.38,1.55,0.00,0.52,0.26,8.76,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,16.75,1.80,1.80,2.84,5.93,1.55,6.70,0.77,0.26,0.26,0.26,2.84,0.00,1.55,0.00,1.03,7.99,2.32,2.84,2.58,2.06,0.77,0.26,14.18,1.03,11.34,1.29,7.73,2.58,5.93,2.32,0.00,2.06,0.00,0.26,0.77,0.26,0.26,0.52,0.00,0.00,22.42,8.76,3.35,0.26,0.00,0.77,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.26,4.64,4.38

t3_32ml8o,"teacher here. this is a complex issue and i personally thank you on behalf of many other teachers fr showing some compassion for our situation. however. it is not a teacher's job to determine the outcomes of tests. it is our job to teach to the best of our ability with the resources we are given and to do our best to change the policies that we disagree with in an honest and transparent manner. this is equivalent to saying that a judge's job is to uphold the law as written, not to reinterpret it the way they think ti should be; the police's job is to enforce the law is written not to apply their own best judgement about whether an action is 'really' a crime. teachers are not entitled to change the outcomes of the tests given to our students. those tests, wrongly or rightly, are there for accountability and circumventing that accountability says that teachers know better than the communities we serve. let us be honest - we actually might know better than the community but that is absolutely not our decision to make. teachers can offer parents guidance in opting their children out of these exams. teachers can refuse to administer these exams. teachers can beg and plead or stand up and scream against these exams publicly and intelligently until the community realizes the mistake it has made by allowing these preposterous funding rules to continue. but cheating on the exams is not a valid form of protest; it is a dishonest attempt at circumventing the consequences that the community has chosen. now, i know - the people who wrote nclb do not have hungry kids attending broke-ass atlanta public schools - they have smarmy rich kids attending private institutions or sterling public academies in wealthy districts. that is a problem. but it is not a problem addressed by these teachers' actions. in the fight for justice for our students, the absolute worst thing that teachers can do it lie, cheat, and make ourselves look dishonest. what our profession needs is to be treated like a profession and what our students need is equitable educational policy - neither of which we can help to accomplish from the wrong side of a scandal.",cqcmvme,392.23435324369433,1,1429063069,37,12,-22699,0,55.319623655914,372.0,574.0,18.0,8,0.05555555555555555,0.0,0.2222222222222222,0.16666666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.0,0.5555555555555556,0.11543758529052647,0.29838709677419356,0.0,0,0.0,373,75.16,73.12,8.08,17.92,20.72,24.93,88.47,54.42,13.94,6.17,0.54,4.29,0.27,0.00,1.07,7.77,8.85,13.40,9.65,2.14,5.09,2.41,14.21,4.83,3.22,1.34,0.00,0.54,6.43,2.95,3.49,0.00,1.07,0.27,10.99,0.27,0.00,0.00,0.00,13.40,2.14,2.41,1.61,1.34,0.54,6.17,1.34,0.54,0.80,0.00,0.54,0.27,0.00,0.00,0.27,17.96,6.17,2.41,9.12,1.34,1.34,1.88,12.87,0.27,5.36,1.61,2.95,0.80,10.99,0.00,0.00,1.34,0.00,0.00,0.54,0.27,0.00,0.27,0.00,0.00,10.19,4.83,1.88,0.00,0.54,0.00,0.00,1.34,0.00,1.61,0.00,0.00

t3_33ltmy,"first let me just say that the answer i suggest is the better paying job, though i also do not have every detail as you do. in the realm of existentialist philosophy, let me just impress upon you this fact: you, ultimately, are the decider. no one is deciding or forcing you to anything, and you must recognize the full weight of this being your decision. with this mindset, you will not feel as much doubt or self-loathing later on when you do decide. anyways, the logic of my recommendation is fairly simple: you have few prospects for your family, financially, with the activist job. however, that is not to say your only or prime obligation is to your family (environmental degradation in general be be chalked up to this mindset of ""i am just doing what i have to for my x""). but, with greater income comes greater security and time. but remember, this is, technically, compromising on your principles and it will be harder for your (likely) enviromentally-idealistic child. now think: ""what do i also need to do to earn my prospective grown child's respect as an enviromentally-active individual/father?"" on this basis, my recommendation is that you can continue to be just as good a person so long as your do something other than just work as corporate shill. and i do not mean donate to environmental causes (that sorta undermines the economic reason in the first place). what i mean is becoming really active in something really meaningful. i am not a member of them, but activity in your local green party or other politically-active, environmental groups that are actually dedicated to your cause (and not the status-quo affirmation of the main political parties). i am basically telling you to get involved in politics, but only something on the level of meaningful political activity can likely, so to say, outweigh the evilness of the corporate route in your consciousness (which is obviously stressed). if you are about to become part of the establishment in one way, you can negate that by also becoming a part of the anti-establishment, which should do much to ease your guilt (and hopefully also be helpful towards actual environmental-political change).",cqmees1,693.3705327971189,1,1429824703,365,78,-8558,0,42.38964492753627,368.0,607.0,15.0,1,0.26666666666666666,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.06666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.2,0.0,1.0,0.027380952380952384,0.26902173913043476,0.0,0,0.0,376,35.24,72.96,62.26,82.79,25.07,20.74,91.76,60.90,16.76,10.37,3.99,0.00,6.12,0.00,0.27,6.38,5.32,14.36,11.97,6.65,7.98,2.13,15.16,7.71,3.19,1.60,1.06,1.86,5.32,4.26,1.06,0.80,0.00,0.00,12.23,0.80,0.00,0.00,0.27,16.49,4.79,1.33,1.60,3.99,1.06,6.12,1.86,0.27,0.80,0.80,0.27,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.27,7.98,2.39,1.60,2.93,1.06,0.53,0.53,13.30,1.33,9.57,0.80,6.91,1.86,3.99,1.06,0.53,1.33,0.00,0.00,0.27,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.27,17.29,3.72,5.85,0.80,0.00,0.27,0.00,1.86,1.06,0.27,3.19,0.27

t3_32yo7o,"are you familiar with the [aristotle's modes of persuasion](the idea is that in rhetoric there are three primary channels of persuasion: ethos (authority), pathos (emotion), and logos (logic). a really good and persuasive argument usually involves all three in balanced measure. it seems that you are mainly convinced of things by authoritative scientific findings and logical arguments, and far less by personal emotional appeals. however, not all people are the same as you. many people are mainly influenced by emotion and anecdote because pathos is a powerful tool. you may well wish people would use more logos, but others can equally well want you to use more pathos. people introducing anecdotes might just be them trying to frame the discussion in terms of the kinds of things that persuade them. if you really want to have a good conversation with them, you have to give them a little of what works for them, not just what works for you. and finally, it is worth considering that when it comes to debating social issues, simply citing statistical studies does not necessarily mean anything. here is an interesting recent [blog post](about how nearly identical studies of gender-bias in stem hiring are finding completely opposite results. people on opposite sides of a debate can both point to valid studies that prove them right. of course that does not mean that anecdote becomes any more reliable, but it does mean that scientific ethos can't be the final word in every debate.

t3_2yaif0,"> right-to-work law, as per my understanding, is that a hired worker no longer must have to associate with, or be held accountable for the dues of union if they are not a member. the mechanism by which right to work laws operate, though, is important. here is the legal framework of how it works in the u.s.: 1. workers in a workplace are allowed to band together and form a union, if they would like. 2. the workers contract with the union, which then gets the authority to speak for the workers. 3. the union negotiates employment contracts with the employer under a collective bargaining agreement. 4. sometimes, the collective bargaining agreement will include an agreement where the employer agrees to exclusively hire members of the union (and thus, that any new employee gets offered a conditional job offer, that says ""we'll officially hire you if you join this union""). 5. right to work laws say, as a matter of law, that the courts will ignore that provision of the contract that ensures exclusivity. effectively, the union and the employer know that they can both agree to something, but that nobody will hold that promise up in court. here's the key: right to work laws only change the ability of the employer to contract. certain terms are off the table. but in a non-right-to-work state, there is nothing stopping an employer from refusing to agree to any kind of union exclusivity. and we tolerate exclusivity in contracts all the time. a mcdonald's franchise owner is not allowed to buy his own beef from other sources not approved by mcdonald's corporate. an actor who agrees to be the face of a national ad campaign will generally have to sign an agreement *not* to appear in advertising for competitors. so for people who generally prefer a hands-off approach on private party freedom to contract, right to work laws are government intrusion into business contracts. these types of contracts are in some ways anticompetitive, but they are voluntary. the very foundations of contract law are that you promise something in exchange for something else. the mcdonald's franchisee agrees to limit his sourcing for food (and gives up his flexibility in decor, menu control, etc.) in exchange for tapping into some of the benefits that come from mcdonald's corporate (a deep ad budget, a ton of consumer goodwill, access to good resources for training, legal support, etc.). and if you think that employers need protection from coercive negotiation tactics and end up getting bullied into ""voluntarily"" signing contracts that they do not really want, is not that an acknowledgement that bargaining is really just about power, and that government should not tip the scales in a particular side's favor (by saying that contracts *can't* do this thing)?",cp7yv6e,281.74479025243437,1,1425797399,30,5,22597,0,55.38970524017469,458.0,730.0,28.0,5,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.10714285714285714,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07142857142857142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.0,0.5,NaN,0.27510917030567683,0.0,0,0.0,468,91.73,55.09,8.10,94.43,18.72,25.21,85.26,50.64,9.83,3.21,0.21,0.43,0.85,0.64,1.07,6.62,9.83,15.81,6.20,3.63,4.70,2.35,10.68,1.50,0.85,1.28,1.07,1.50,4.91,4.70,0.21,0.00,0.00,0.00,7.26,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.64,12.18,1.28,1.71,2.14,3.63,1.28,4.70,1.50,0.21,0.85,0.43,1.07,0.43,0.21,0.00,0.43,15.17,3.42,3.21,7.91,1.50,0.43,0.43,9.83,1.28,9.19,0.64,7.26,1.28,10.47,0.64,0.00,2.78,0.00,0.00,0.43,0.00,0.00,0.43,0.00,0.00,18.38,5.77,5.34,0.43,0.00,0.21,0.00,1.28,0.85,1.71,1.71,1.07

t3_3gincm,"there are a few things which are concerning with orbital debris. first though, a little primer on orbital mechanics. your velocity and your orbit are the same thing. if you give me the velocity (that is speed+direction) and location of a spacecraft at a single point, i can tell you its orbital path.^1 second, there are certain orbital ""sweet spots"" which are beneficial for various reasons. one of the most beneficial (and most crowded) is geostationary orbit. geostationary orbit is where your orbit matches earth's rotation such that the satellite appears to always be at the same place in the sky. it is great for communication satellites. geostationary orbit is a single circular ring around earth. it is at the equator, about 36000 km from earth's surface. it is not a plane, or a 3-dimensional space, it is a single line. ok, so why is this a concern: first, things in orbit move very, very fast. when i said that velocity tells me your orbit, i didn't give an idea of how fast these velocities are. the space station for instance is travelling at about 27,600 kph relative to earth's surface. that's crazy fast. if you were listening to the song [about walking 1000 miles](on the iss, you would have traveled a thousand miles by the end.^2 at those speeds, an impact is absolutely devastating. we are talking multiple times faster than speeding bullets. also, orbits need constant maintenance. due to the gravity of the sun and moon, anything in orbit is constantly being tugged around and pushed to different orbital paths. this means that debris which can no longer be controlled will not just stay put, but possibly come intersect with orbits we want to use. satellites in active use are tweaking their orbits constantly to keep where they need to be. when they get to the end of their useful life, they are generally either sent to burn up in earth's atmosphere, or to a very high orbit to be out of the way. the nightmare scenario is a single impact between two larger objects causing a lot of uncontrolled debris though. it would be too small to see where it is, or predict where it will go, but yes, a bolt or a scrap of solar panel can completely wreck a large spacecraft. ----- ^1 i will probably use a computer though because i am lazy. ^2 [source](",ctyigsj,295.9426589976232,1,1439251080,41,10,2972,0,65.26442794547228,395.0,589.0,26.0,141,0.038461538461538464,0.0,0.07692307692307693,0.34615384615384615,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.038461538461538464,0.038461538461538464,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.0,0.0,0.6153846153846153,0.10047619047619047,0.2582278481012658,0.0,0,0.0,406,64.57,56.86,76.67,38.94,16.24,18.47,83.50,52.96,11.33,5.42,1.72,0.49,1.97,0.00,1.23,5.91,8.62,12.07,10.34,7.88,5.42,0.99,16.26,5.67,2.71,2.71,4.68,2.71,3.20,1.97,1.23,0.25,0.00,0.25,6.16,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,11.33,0.74,2.46,1.72,3.45,0.99,4.19,1.97,0.49,0.99,0.25,0.49,0.00,0.25,0.00,0.25,3.69,0.74,0.74,1.48,0.49,0.25,1.23,13.05,0.99,20.44,5.67,10.59,5.17,0.25,0.49,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.74,0.00,0.00,0.74,0.00,0.00,18.97,6.40,5.17,0.25,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.48,0.49,1.48,1.48,2.22
t3_3hoq7p,"first of all, in countries that ban firearms you see the gun violence drop, true, but you also see non-gun-related violent crime go up. outlawing guns will only do one thing: make it easier for bad guys to kill good guys. in days of prohibition they outlawed alcohol, yet criminals still got it and regular citizens didn't. certain types of drugs are outlawed yet you still have people getting their hands on them. i think you will find that even if you ban guns people will still have guns ... except they will not be the good people. people like penn jilette and alex cross are good when it comes to pointing out why we need guns. penn points out that in the amendment it says that the right shall not be infringed and that it is the right of the people to carry guns as the militia does. it does not say it is the right of the militia (cops) to carry a gun, rather it is the right of ordinary citizens, because the people that wrote that document in there were fighting a war against their tyrannical government that had better weapons than them. the gun rights for citizens are not in there simply to hunt, but to protect yourself. a guy blew up people with his shoe at an airport, so we take our shoes off there; a guy shot up a school, so now school are gun-free zones and it is illegal to enter a school with a gun ... there you go. we are not going to outlaw all guns simply because they were used to kill children at a school, just like we will not outlaw all shoes because one was used to blow up a plane. it's true that there weren't fully automatic weapons in the days our country fought it is war of independence ... but that means no one had those weapons ... the point is to arm yourself just as the government does, so if the government has fully automatic weapons, therefor to best protect yourself you might need one too. however, i disagree that we need fully automatics anyway, you can do a lot more a lot more precise with a semi automatic than you can a fully automatic. how's this for convincing? hitler took guns away from the jews and only the jews ... then the holocaust happened. millions of jews murdered by their government ... imagine if they had a even a little pistol to protect themselves, that's millions of guns being fired against the germans and would have obviously inflicted some heavy casualties on the nazis to the point wwii might not have happened because hitler would have been so ruined by the loss of half his army. stalin took away his peoples guns ... murdered them. mao took away their guns ... murdered them. castro ... pol pot ... and even today in our lifetime north korean citizens do not have guns, and their people are being raped and killed by their own military.",cu9k2tb,727.9731831281317,1,1440088398,135,11,34095,0,72.89665330661325,499.0,687.0,29.0,1,0.10344827586206896,0.0,0.3448275862068966,0.41379310344827586,0.0,0.0,0.034482758620689655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06896551724137931,0.0,0.9655172413793103,0.0776862026862027,0.22044088176352705,0.0,0,0.0,502,55.60,82.03,15.62,3.28,17.31,15.94,85.66,56.77,13.15,7.97,0.40,1.59,2.39,0.60,2.99,5.18,7.77,12.75,10.36,7.37,5.98,2.19,16.14,2.99,2.19,0.60,1.59,1.59,6.37,1.99,4.38,0.00,3.19,0.40,12.35,0.00,0.80,0.00,1.39,11.55,1.20,2.19,1.79,1.59,1.59,4.58,1.20,0.40,0.40,0.40,1.59,1.00,0.40,0.20,0.20,7.97,1.59,0.80,3.19,2.19,1.00,3.78,10.36,1.99,11.16,1.59,6.97,2.59,1.99,0.20,0.00,0.20,0.60,1.99,0.20,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.20,15.34,9.56,3.19,0.20,0.20,0.20,0.00,0.60,0.00,1.00,0.40,0.00

t3_3ex1vr,">theft: copying something can't possibly be theft because theft requires taking something away and copying does not do that. thinking about ip violations as theft (defined as depriving someone of their rightfully owned property) is, in my mind, a wrong way to go about it. ownership of something does not just mean you have possession of it, but that you have the right to *control its use.* we talk about violations of ip as ""theft"" when in reality, it is closer to a violation of the right to control the property. so if a person has a patent on a widget, he has the right to license and control the use of that widget. if he does not think it should be used in, say, weapons manufacturing- he has the right to deny the use of his ip in that field. now say that a weapons company ignores this and uses the widget anyway. he has been wronged in two senses: first by loss of profits from the use of his widget (wherein the thing stolen is the *profit*, not the widget itself). second, in the *control of the use* of the widget. the weapons manufacturer didn't deprive the inventor of *possession,* but he did deprive the inventor of *control.* so while it may not be theft of the property (on your definition of theft), it *is still a violation of property rights.* edit- to the economic utility point: i am not sure i get your point. the argument in favor of ip is that ip will not be developed without protection for use and profit. this seems clearly correct: say a corporation could steal any patent from any inventor and deprive the inventor of profit or control without fear of reprimand. what incentive would the inventor have to devote time to inventing? what incentive would any person have to do research, when they would not be able to profit from the research. >what we do know for sure, if a prohibition on commercial copying is implemented, is that individual rights will be violated. how?",ctj5yub,368.38837024372066,1,1438106298,90,8,412,0,62.0747463768116,345.0,511.0,18.0,18,0.0,0.0,0.16666666666666666,0.05555555555555555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.0,0.2777777777777778,0.10964264493676257,0.1855072463768116,0.0,0,0.0,345,73.08,48.84,5.86,3.55,23.00,21.16,86.09,58.84,12.46,5.22,0.87,0.58,1.16,2.03,0.58,7.25,9.57,15.94,11.30,4.06,6.09,3.48,17.39,1.74,1.16,1.74,0.87,0.87,8.70,3.19,5.51,0.29,2.61,1.45,7.54,0.00,0.00,0.00,2.03,17.39,2.03,4.64,2.32,4.06,1.45,5.22,1.16,0.00,0.87,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,7.25,0.58,1.45,2.32,2.32,0.87,1.16,14.20,0.87,7.83,0.29,5.51,2.03,4.64,0.00,0.00,1.74,0.00,0.00,0.29,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.29,17.97,4.64,4.06,1.16,0.00,0.58,0.00,0.58,0.58,0.58,1.74,4.06

t3_30059g,"children are the *opposite* of a negative externality - the parents shoulder a disproportionate percentage of the costs, but all of society benefits from having a replacement generation to take care of us then the current generation becomes too decrepit and incontinent. therefore parenthood is *not* equivalent to pet ownership - even from a purely ""public good"" perspective. it therefore benefits society as a whole to incentivize parenthood (to a point) in a way that pet ownership cannot match. the public will benefit from children (in the aggregate). it will not benefit from dogs (in the aggregate) in anywhere near the same way. therefore, as an incentive for parenthood, we need to accommodate parents/kids in a way that we *don't* need to accommodate pet owners. (and before you bring up overpopulation, note that the us and many other developed nations currently have a birth rate [below replacement levels](- we are maintaining population because of immigration, not because we are having so many babies.) finally, another point (which someone already brought up, but which they did not emphasize and which you ignored completely) - **you can't leave a child alone at home** the way you can a dog. not until they are [*12 years old*](in some states. so having child-free restaurants is a *much* bigger burden on parents than a dog-free restaurant is for dog owners. at the very least you have to pay a babysitter, which is expensive and which some people are not comfortable with. meanwhile, fluffy can easily stay at home alone for 3 hours with zero harm to them and zero chance of having them taken away for neglect. this is a **huge** distinction for parents, even if it is something that may not occur to you if you do not have kids of your own. [edit] i just want to add - there are some restaurants (and other venues) where you really should not bring your kids, either. yes, it is a pain in the ass, but that's life as a parent (and i say this *as* a parent). there is a different expectation in delmonico's than in olive garden - although that goes both ways, of course.

t3_30059g,"op, let me start by saying that i have worked professionally with animals my entire life, have three dogs, am generally in favor of the notion that parents need to wrangle children better, and am generally in favor of the notion of taking my dogs with me everywhere they can reasonably go. however, as some others have touched on in this thread, allergies to dogs are the central issue. i think just about everything else can be regulated-for or worked-around or can be handled by stipulating an assumption of good training, so i am going to focus on the allergy component of the problem, as it is the one that can't be reasonably controlled-for. allergies to pets *typically* (human medicine is not my thing) are triggered by either pet dander, saliva, or both. pet fur sheds ubiquitously anywhere the dog goes, in shedding breeds -- there are seasons where it is elevated for certain dogs, but this cannot be predicted and shedding never stops, just slows. non-shedding breeds still can trigger allergies by leaving saliva on surfaces (although the risk does not last for long, if i had to guess, though an allergist would have to pipe up on that one), and anyway, shedding dogs are much more common than non-shedding breeds or crosses. individuals who are sensitive to pet dander can be astoundingly sensitive to small amounts in the environment, and sometimes their reactions can be very serious. it's good that we have many common areas which are closed indoor spaces, because this helps keep them free of a lot of dangerous environmental contaminants. air coming into buildings like stores is typically at least a little bit filtered in some way, and the buildings are kept clean as a matter of course, so fur and dust and other allergens tracked in are kept to a minimum. however, just because mitigation measures are in place does not mean that it is a good idea to introduce more of a potential problem-particle into an area. it is like this: sound medical reasoning often centers not around the conveniently simple idea of picking one big risk to reduce, but rather around the idea of identifying many many tiny possible risks and contributing factors and mitigating each one as much as possible to result in a cumulatively reduced chance of problems. managing contaminants in an environment is a lot like managing pathogen cells in a body or managing chemical contamination in a lab -- you have to be thorough, or it simply will not be good enough. my dogs are well-behaved, highly intelligent, all-around awesome. however, just like anything else that sheds into the air (for instance, when i used to smoke cigarettes a few years ago), i know they can cause problems for a statistically significant number of other people, so it logically follows that these things need to be kept out of as many public shared spaces as is reasonably possible. open outdoor air (with reasonable distancing in the case of smoke ... with fur, there is a lot less drift to worry about) is a liability for anyone willing to step into it, and that's an inevitable contract with nature we all share. however, inside a store, someone with serious risk of anaphylaxis if they contact a piece or two of pet dander should not be put at extra risk for the convenience of someone else who will suffer no harm from leaving their dog somewhere else for the time being. until immunology becomes a polished and finished science like physics (good luck waiting on that, since physiology and medicine and all related sciences that build on them are still pretty raw, fresh, and guess-laden) there probably will not be a reasonable solution to this besides keeping public enclosed spaces generally free of pet dander, with exceptions only made for service dogs or dogs aiding in emergency situations. quick edit to note that i somehow missed that you would already edited and awarded deltas (i'd left this tab lying open for quite a while before getting around to replying), and to say that i think dogs are quite a lot like children and that if it weren't for the allergy factor, i would completely agree with your original position.",cpo9jne,1146.5065736725476,1,1427143047,478,53,27093,0,34.67044505740276,706.0,1122.0,19.0,1,0.05263157894736842,0.0,0.5263157894736842,0.5263157894736842,0.0,0.0,0.10526315789473684,0.05263157894736842,0.15789473684210525,0.05263157894736842,0.0,0.0,0.10526315789473684,0.0,1.5789473684210522,0.057605311355311356,0.2747875354107649,0.0,0,0.0,715,72.07,34.76,59.06,35.55,37.63,22.24,86.57,53.01,10.21,3.92,2.24,0.28,0.42,0.00,0.98,6.15,5.87,16.64,9.37,6.43,7.13,1.68,14.27,5.17,2.94,0.70,0.84,3.92,5.73,3.08,2.52,0.84,0.14,0.28,4.90,0.14,0.14,0.00,0.00,17.62,2.66,2.80,2.24,6.15,1.40,5.59,0.84,0.00,0.42,0.14,2.52,0.42,1.82,0.00,0.42,6.15,0.84,0.84,1.54,1.54,1.68,2.10,10.77,0.98,14.13,1.54,9.37,3.08,2.10,0.00,0.84,0.56,0.00,0.00,0.70,0.00,0.14,0.28,0.14,0.14,13.15,2.94,5.59,0.14,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.82,0.00,0.70,1.68,0.28

t3_31iyzr,"well, a couple things. first off, the media (both sides) revels in making all events more intense than they seem. life in the us is just as calm as it is in sweden. i live in chicago, and often times i hear about protests and demonstrations about who-knows-what that occurred in my city, and i never even saw a whiff. quite simply, life in the us is more or less the same as in european countries. now, your financial questions are vastly more important. essentially what you will be doing is swapping the allocation of your money and risk potential. i'll break it down: in the us (for it professionals): salary: high to very high healthcare: potentially low to potentially very high education: potentially free to potentially very high sweden (from the sounds of it) salary: medium-high healthcare: essentially free education: free by going to the us, you will probably raise the bar on your salary potential. i believe even at $250k+/year, you can still reasonably pay an effective tax rate % of somewhere in the mid-thirties. if you have a good health plan from your job, it will vary. if you have a high deductible ppo, it means you might pay the first few thousand dollars out of pocket, but have the option of going to any doctor you want. if you have an hmo, you pay very little out of pocket for visits, but are limited in choice. either way, you will still have to pay roughly 100-400/mo in insurance costs. education: you will be a resident in some state, and when your children go to college they will get in-state tuition if they go to a state school. if they go out of state or to a prestigious private university, they will probably end up paying a lot out of pocket. there are scholarships to lessen this, but that is an uncontrollable variable because it depends on the scholastic success of your kids. if you think about your compensation as x, and education, healthcare, social programs, and taxes as a, b, c, and d, in the us you get to separate those variables. in sweden, you just have x and d, as everything else basically gets rolled into your much higher taxes. there are plenty of examples where you could get a much better return on your money spent by living in america, but you also might not. if you move here and suddenly a family member gets cancer, and then your kid goes to harvard, well then you might end up ""worse off"" financially than you would have in sweden. but if you come here, get a big raise, pay less taxes, have a family in general good health with kids that get good grades and go to fine state schools, then you will probably come out on top. i would honestly ignore any social qualms that you may have about the us as some sort of chaotic place. perhaps come visit the us and see how it is one big media sham to drum up controversy. i forgot to mention sick days/vacation. this is massively dependent on your company. if you work for a big box corporation with 10k+ employees, your vacation/sick time might not be very good, something around 2 weeks per yer with sick days counting as vacation. but if you work for a smaller, more flexible firm, with good negotiation skills you can probably get something a little closer to the european model. but honestly, do not expect it to be too crazy. most american workplaces have an almost negative view of too much time off, it is kind of strange. in summary, no one can tell you if america will be better. the american model places more responsibility into your hands, and therefore increases risk. the potential reward is higher, but so is the potential loss. edit: i forgot to mention. the us is so big that you have a whole bunch of microcultures. if you do not like the whole hyper-religious aspect of all that shit you see on the news, just do not work in any of those states. work in oregon, or washington, or california, colorado or the east coast. or any big city really. there are enough microcultures in the us that you will have more than enough choice on what type of people you want to live near.",cq20phi,1523.5505861229765,1,1428279775,146,24,3027,0,65.7672746935833,730.0,1049.0,38.0,16,0.02631578947368421,0.02631578947368421,0.2631578947368421,0.3157894736842105,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02631578947368421,0.07894736842105263,0.02631578947368421,0.763157894736842,0.02827307827307827,0.24794520547945206,0.0,0,0.0,741,63.91,85.38,49.45,40.31,19.50,15.11,89.34,54.25,13.09,9.04,1.21,1.21,5.94,0.00,0.67,3.91,6.21,14.57,7.83,6.75,7.69,0.94,13.09,7.29,4.18,0.94,1.21,4.05,4.86,2.83,2.02,0.40,0.27,0.27,10.66,0.27,0.00,0.00,0.00,13.63,1.48,1.08,2.43,7.96,0.54,4.99,1.35,0.67,0.27,0.27,2.02,0.27,1.62,0.00,0.13,11.20,1.89,3.10,4.18,2.29,0.54,0.54,10.39,4.18,15.65,1.89,10.66,2.97,5.67,0.94,0.40,3.64,0.13,0.00,0.81,0.13,0.40,0.00,0.40,0.00,15.79,5.13,6.34,1.21,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.94,0.27,0.13,0.67,1.08
t3_31iyzr,"here is the thing, you are comparing the situation difference between the average swede and the average american when you are not average. the average us compensation is higher than the average swedish compensation but, for you the difference might be even higher this just comes down to what these companies are willing to offer. based on a quick google search of it salary in us and sweden i am coming up with $78k/yr in us and $62k/yr in sweden. i am coming up with after tax income of $43k in sweden and $68k in us. education, it comes down to you doing the numbers for yourself. your kid is 6 right now, assume that you work for the next 12 years at the higher us after tax pay, does that number pay for college? well it should, according to the [suny](website it will cost about $22k/yr for college. i picked suny because i am assuming new york is a contender for prospective employers. so can you save $88k over the next 12 years making $24k more per year. it would seem so. same exercise for healthcare except this will also be a negotiation with your prospective employer. generally, the more prestigious the position, the better the insurance coverage will be and if they are courting you from sweden to come to the us chances this will be a good package. sick time, and vacation time. the us does not regulate either of these like sweden apparently does. that means these are things you will have to negotiate up front with your employer. some companies treat any day you are not at work as a day off and you have one pool of days you can be away from work. some companies have two pools, one for sick time and one for vacation time. sick time applies to family members for most companies so it is very unlikely there'd be a 3rd pool for when family members are sick and there is little chance you wouldn't collect a full days pay when you used sick time for either yourself or family. chances are if you are highly sought over you could negotiate for 4 weeks of vacation but anything over that is not often heard of but that does not mean you should not ask for it. society: i had a coworker whose wife was from japan and she had the same misconception about the war-zone aspect of the us. here is the thing, we have 322m people spread out over almost 10m sq km. so we have over 30x the people sweden does and 20x the land mass so when the media leads you to believe that all these things are happening right next to each other, they are painting a bad picture. the bigger thing for you will more likely be the small things. from my understanding swedes do not talk to strangers almost under any circumstance where in the us a good number of people will think it rude not to say hi as you pass someone in a hallway or sidewalk etc. (this does not apply to busy crowded hallways and sidewalks and is not very strict by any means) really, this probably all comes down to whether you and your family *want* to live in the us. life is too short to come to the us because you make extra money and can get more stuff. why not visit one of the cities that has a company that wants to hire you. maybe you can get them to pay your airfare and hotel while you are here even. see if you like it and then decide but do not decide for or against until you visit.",cq2hqkc,1557.4710341475404,1,1428286488,146,24,9740,0,71.29737439222045,617.0,831.0,29.0,2,0.06896551724137931,0.0,0.13793103448275862,0.3448275862068966,0.0,0.0,0.06896551724137931,0.0,0.034482758620689655,0.0,0.0,0.034482758620689655,0.1724137931034483,0.0,0.8620689655172413,0.08092403628117914,0.1880064829821718,0.0,0,0.0,626,54.25,87.82,43.16,23.28,21.59,13.42,89.14,59.27,15.02,8.95,0.96,2.08,5.27,0.16,0.48,6.07,6.87,14.54,10.70,5.43,7.19,2.08,15.65,7.19,3.67,1.44,1.44,3.35,2.56,1.12,1.28,0.00,0.32,0.00,12.46,0.80,0.00,0.32,0.00,12.94,1.92,1.44,1.60,4.47,0.32,5.11,0.96,0.64,0.32,0.00,1.28,0.00,1.28,0.00,0.00,9.11,3.35,0.80,4.15,0.96,0.16,1.12,12.78,2.24,13.74,1.76,6.87,5.11,4.79,1.92,0.64,2.08,0.00,0.16,0.16,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.16,0.00,10.06,4.47,2.08,0.16,0.00,0.16,0.00,0.16,0.00,0.32,0.48,2.24
t3_3jn9lh,"i know some of my points have been made already, but i think i have a few new things to add specifically to amateur football. first off, there is a definite issue with cte in the proffessional and even college games, however i think there is some confusion over what causes this. there is a small link to concussions and this disorder, however they do believe the main cause is long term ""micro-collisions"" so basically hitting for a significant portions of your life. there is major questions if the link exists in amateur players as they do not have the same long term exposure to these collisions. there is a link with concussions and early dementia, and possibly alzhiemers. it appears these links are most heightened for those who have concussions in pre-adolescent ""pee-wee"" football. which leads me to say that tackle pee-wee football should be abolished, and i am fully in favor of this. this link also exists, even more prevelently in some occurences, in most women's sports, as girls and women are significantly more susceptible to concussions. there is the bigger benefit vs detriment argument as well. a lot of kids are greatly benefited by what football gives them, both mentally and physically. it is a violent game, and draws the kids that enjoy that violence. at the same time it teaches discipline and when linked with school forces many kids to actually do their studies, when they do not have much more reason to succeed. study after study shows kids involved in sports live longer more successful lives than those who aren't....football is not outside of this. football also draws a body type that does not usually do well at sports. its for big strong guys. they can't just play soccer instead, many will play nothing and continue a sedentary lifestyle. the big question is, is football a net possitive or negative in the life of people? there are studies showing kids who play sports live longer, go further in school and make more money...pure and simple since football is included in this it is hard to say it is a societal negative. i understand that the preference would be that people play a different sport that is less dangerous. that completely ignores reality though, sports are not in a vacuum. if one sport's popularity and participation reduces, all that energy does not go to another sport. it gets dilluted amongst all recreational activities, many of which hold almost no benefits.",curhmfk,166.6218070952872,1,1441464699,112,17,72264,0,59.97407608695656,414.0,633.0,24.0,2,0.08333333333333333,0.0,0.16666666666666666,0.625,0.0,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.041666666666666664,0.041666666666666664,0.0,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.041666666666666664,0.0,1.0833333333333333,0.07860593512767425,0.27294685990338163,0.0,0,0.0,420,48.71,42.44,51.27,70.57,19.09,21.90,88.10,51.90,11.90,3.57,1.90,0.00,0.24,0.00,1.43,8.33,5.48,11.43,9.52,6.90,6.67,2.86,13.81,7.86,4.76,2.14,0.48,5.24,4.76,3.57,1.19,0.00,0.48,0.00,7.38,0.00,0.24,0.71,0.24,14.76,3.57,1.90,1.19,3.81,1.67,4.76,1.43,0.71,0.48,0.24,2.14,0.71,1.43,0.00,0.00,5.00,0.48,0.95,2.62,1.43,0.24,0.95,13.33,0.24,12.14,0.71,8.33,3.10,2.86,5.71,0.24,0.24,0.00,0.00,0.48,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.48,0.00,14.05,6.67,4.29,0.00,0.00,0.24,0.00,0.95,0.95,0.95,0.00,0.00
t3_30808s,"a little history on where the whole recent ""support the troops"" thing came from - during vietnam, there were a lot of attacks directed at the returning troops, which was especially ironic given how many of them were drafted and didn't have exemptions such as going to college. since then, and more specifically during the 2000's, the us public shifted, due in part to its guilt over how it treated vietnam vets, to supporting the troops as an acknowledgment that the troops weren't personally the ones at fault for the wars as much as crooked politicians sending them in. >i just feel like the whole ""support the troops"" and honor your veterans thing is not deserved. despite what our military does, going against it in any way publicly almost always leads to backlash and ridicule. you just cant not support the military without being anti american, or so it seems. this question gets asked a lot around here so i have to ask - where has it actually been the case in your life where you not supporting the troops has meant you being called anti-american? and even then, who even enforces it or encourages it? i'll tell you something: the military itself does not care. we want people to actually volunteer time and effort with things like the wounded warrior project, and not give empty ""i support the troops"" statements. > i feel like the overwhelming support of veterans and military is due to the personal connections we have to lives who are risked in military affairs, and not in the actual actions the military takes and whether it is actually trying to protect us or just take advantage of our support. actually, stats have shown that the average american's connection to the military is smaller than ever before in its history. for instance, during ww2, with a population of 130 million, we had over *six million* volunteers and *ten million* drafted. given that almost all of these were males aged 18-30, that was a huge chunk of the male population (nearly one fourth) that was in the military. during vietnam, from 1965-1973, over 8.7 million americans were in uniform for a country with a population in the 200ish million range. again, a significant chunk. today, however, less than 1% of americans are actively serving in the military and our veteran population is [shrinking considerably](our disconnect from military affairs is growing at all levels of society, most notably [at the senate level](where in 1970, over 70% of congress served in the military, while today it is only 18%. not surprisingly, the politicians have been increasingly awful at their understanding of military affairs - from cutting budgets while expecting more capabilities, personally meddling in military affairs for political gain, etc. and to your last point: >and not in the actual actions the military takes and whether it is actually trying to protect us or just take advantage of our support. what do you think? i think you have got that backwards. the military does not decide where or when it goes to war - the politicians do because the us has a strict adherence to civilian leadership over the military. they decide on the action and the military then formulates and shapes its plans around those civilian requirements and then submits them to the civilian leadership - who can then accept it, modify it, or overrule it. for instance, when the bush administration pushed to invade iraq, the army repeatedly said the bush administration's projections for troops were too low - the army repeatedly said they needed 3x the troops to properly secure the country and ensure a safe transition. you know what donald rumsfeld and other bush administration officials said? they told the army to pound sand and removed generals who didn't fit their pre-conceived idea of a short, clean, low-troop involvement war. well, as they say, that's not how it worked out and the rest is history. this of course ties into my point about how fewer people than ever have served in the military in congress - the lack of understanding around our military's capabilities has made the military increasingly a play thing for politicians who are disconnected from the realities of their arbitrary budget cuts and their ridiculous concepts of foreign policy because they have no personal skin in the game, and neither does the average american, which makes up their constituency. if anything is being taken advantage of, it is not the military getting a lot of popular support from the civilian population, but the politicians who are taking advantage of the disconnect between the civilian population and the military and the ignorance of military affairs that disconnect creates, which makes it easier for politicians to get the civilian population to stomach their use of military force",cppzk7v,1078.5231328536606,1,1427267071,165,20,-21806,0,39.06463740458017,786.0,1294.0,28.0,10,0.07142857142857142,0.0,0.07142857142857142,0.42857142857142855,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.0,0.17857142857142858,0.0,0.07142857142857142,0.0,0.0,0.25,0.0,1.1071428571428572,0.04162304652500731,0.22519083969465647,0.0,0,0.0,802,78.45,67.32,47.99,56.38,28.64,25.44,86.78,54.36,11.85,5.49,0.87,1.62,1.25,0.00,1.75,6.36,9.35,14.59,6.61,5.36,7.36,2.24,14.09,4.61,2.62,3.12,2.49,2.24,5.36,3.37,1.75,0.37,0.75,0.50,9.60,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.25,11.60,2.00,1.75,0.62,2.74,0.87,4.86,1.00,0.00,0.50,0.50,0.62,0.25,0.37,0.00,0.00,15.21,3.12,2.24,8.23,1.87,0.87,3.62,9.10,1.25,13.59,1.87,7.48,4.36,2.74,0.25,0.00,0.25,0.00,0.37,0.12,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.12,0.00,14.21,2.87,4.99,0.25,0.00,0.50,0.00,1.50,0.75,1.12,0.50,1.75

t3_3fz5pa,"what you are describing is genetic programming. perhaps we will achieve sentience sooner than digitized humans. doing it through genetic programming has a few issues, however. consider consciousness. have you figured it out? yes? good, i am glad we had this discussion, turn in plans for your nobel prize and let the singularity begin. no? that's disappointing. oh well. consciousness is very complex. how do you test if something has met the parameters for intelligence? solving intelligent tests? at one point, that test was chess. we did it, we made computers that were very good at making chess moves, but they had no idea what chess was, what it symbolized, what the significance of chess was, they only knew some numbers tied to some positions. they likely didn't even know what winning or losing meant. next, there was the turing test. eugene goostman beat the turing test, but was still not considered to have our level of consciousness, if any at all. this is because the turing test is very, very good at determining if you are simulating consciousness. but not if you are actually conscious. imagine it like school tests. what are they really measuring? how good are you at math or how good are you at getting the answers to the test? you would think they are the same, but does getting a high math score prove that you know what math is? why it is significant? why it is beautiful? why these equations are important in everyday life? no. a high math score just means you know how to solve the problems on the test. then there is the self awareness test, the tokyo test, etc. we have a history of not having the best way to determine consciousness. we are not sure what it is. maybe consciousness is a spectrum or continuum and we have already solved consciousness, but the ai we are making is not conscious enough. but back to genetic programming, eliminating what does not work and letting the best survive. the problem with genetic programming is, let us say you do find a way to test consciousness. it is probably going to involve a lot of factors, right? ability to have opinions, ability to change itself, ability to feel, ability to use natural language, ability to create, debate, cmv, etc. consider the pragmatics. how long it takes for each ai to see if they pass they test or to even realize they are testing. if you just force them, for all you know, you could just be making an ai that's programmed specifically to do each thing individually without filling in the gaps of consciousness in between. no, you need ais that do a bunch of those things individually. how long do you leave it alone to see if it does anything before you eliminate the ai? or do you take up an ungodly amount of resources to keep a bunch of complex computers the size of warehouses around, possibly taking up miles? and you are doing this with each iteration. it could take forever. then, consider the ethics. killing an ai because it is not ""good enough?"" sound familiar to anyone? are we allowed to do that because they are subhuman or something? that's another consideration. is it okay to have an ai thrown into a test it knows nothing about only to kill it before it has a chance to have a quality life? in all likelihood, because of the randomness of their iterations, most of the ais will be insane if they do become sentient and they will suffer. they will suffer real bad. so, genetic programming, in my non-expert opinion, is not a good approach to conscious ai. feel free to cmv.",cttcblp,397.68843914529583,1,1438849745,30,8,2290,0,70.40683904859189,623.0,920.0,55.0,11,0.0,0.0,0.14545454545454545,0.07272727272727272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01818181818181818,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07272727272727272,0.0,0.3090909090909091,NaN,0.2102728731942215,0.0,0,0.0,624,37.39,71.80,36.37,62.24,11.35,20.03,90.54,57.85,15.38,7.53,0.32,1.76,3.21,0.00,2.24,7.85,6.57,11.06,12.82,5.77,6.25,2.40,21.15,3.37,1.44,2.88,0.16,2.56,5.13,3.53,1.60,0.00,0.32,0.80,8.97,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,20.99,7.05,4.01,2.24,4.97,1.44,5.45,1.12,0.48,0.32,0.32,0.32,0.00,0.32,0.00,0.00,9.29,1.92,3.04,1.92,3.37,0.64,2.72,14.74,1.44,8.33,1.28,5.13,2.08,5.13,0.64,0.00,0.16,0.00,0.32,0.64,0.00,0.00,0.32,0.32,0.00,15.87,5.93,5.93,0.00,0.00,2.88,0.00,0.16,0.32,0.64,0.00,0.00
t3_2zkcfb,"i can understand why you feel this way, but i believe you are wrong for many reasons. for one, your point about the us using whatever means necessary: >all convey the same idea. that united states will not think twice to cease whatever it wants by force. its method will imply either lying to the population, or shaping their opinion through mass media. by the way, we do not have wmd (if it ever should be raised as a point). that would be false. the us wanted assad out of syria in 2011 - even when he crossed that ""red line,"" however, the president could not muster enough support or energy from his own people and congress to authorize any sort of military action against syria. the us also wanted to restore somalia's government in the early 90s under a un mission - it withdrew after videos of a few dead american soldiers were dragged through the streets angered the us populace at our involvement. which, furthermore raises my next point: shaping their opinion through mass media is grossly overstated. the us has access to those same media sources that you linked - indeed, the us populace as a whole has a very negative view of the us government from the all-time low approval ratings of congress and the often unwarranted hate and vitriol towards president obama. furthermore, recent history will tell you that the us has often let public opinion go against the best interests of the us government - for instance, the us populace wanted the us to get out of iraq and afghanistan as quickly as possible. leaving iraq though left them vulnerable to isis, and that's why we are back there and why we are not so quick to leave afghanistan. >people on the street here usually say that we, latin america, are next: that the us is coming for either our water, or our natural resources, or whatever. and recently, the us has established a military base in paraguay: a couple things: * the us does not establish bases against the host country's will during times of peace. the us is often invited or paid to come in to those countries. other bases, such as those in europe or japan, are a legacy of the post-ww2 occupation of defeated foes. the us has bases in bahrain, qatar, the uae for instance because the host countries want the us there to protect them against iran. the us has bases in south korea because the south korean government wants the us guarantee against north korea. * speaking of being invited back: there are serious talks by the philippine government of amending their constitution to allow us troops and bases back in their country to protect them against china. even vietnam, a country the us fought for over a decade, wants the us military to come back -- this time to *protect* them against china. i also believe your point on resources is absolutely incorrect. for one, the us is one of the most resource rich countries on earth -- and that's even before fracking became a thing. the us has had ample opportunity to seize countries for their resources, but has not and won't. for instance, after ww2, the world could have been picked apart by the only country with nuclear weapons, a giant strategic air force, and the world's largest navy in history - so what did the us do? it disarmed and didn't re-arm until the korean war made it clear that communism was going to spread with violence. now i will address a few other points ------ **myth**: the us is interested in war because it helps their businesses and the military-industrial complex this is false for many reasons. for one, the us does not actually spend that much of its budget on new weapons. over 42% of its budget is spent on wages, benefits, etc. with another 25-28% spent on training operations and maintenance. in fact, only roughly 16% of its budget is spent on new acquisitions. another 14% is spent on r&d, whose benefits such as gps, cell phones, the internet, etc. have had an innumerable effect on civilian life. and note that r&d money is not just spent on contractors: the dod is one of the largest departments that issues grants to university graduate students and professors who do research on everything from new medical treatments to computer network technology. contrast that to countries like china and india where 25-35% of their budgets are on new acquisitions. if anything, the military industrial complex in their countries benefits far more than ours does. secondly, all the talk of how much lobbying power the military-industrial-complex has ignores how much lobbying power the major us corporations have that have a vested interest in maintaining *peace*. for instance, companies like wal mart and apple *need* stability to expand their presence in new markets. pissing off countries and having them eject you is not good for their business. likewise, whenever tensions in the middle east rise, oil prices go up -- which means that costs to do business go way in the us, hurting most companies. plus, *everyone* likes to talk about how war between the us and china will never happen because of business ties - so then if you buy that logic, then you also have to buy the argument that major business also influence the us to *not* go to war. ------ **myth**: the us is an imperialist force this could not be further from the truth. even during the height of the cold war, with the us competing against the soviet union for influence in the world, the us was staunchly **for** decolonization. people forget but all throughout the 50s and 60s, europeans fought many wars to *hold onto* their colonial possessions. the french in indochina and algeria, the dutch in the indies, and the belgians in the congo to name a few of the often extremely brutal wars meant to keep control over people who wished for self determination. in fact, the us came out staunchly against those countries, even angering many of them who were our allies. for instance, the us repudiated the uk, france, and israel's attempt to take back the suez canal from egypt who nationalized it in the mid 1950s. if the us were imperialist, or had imperialist ambitions, it would have gladly used its massive army and navy after ww2 to conquer the countries it was occupied in. or they certainly could have supported its allies in holding onto those resource rich colonies - they didn't, even if some of them (like vietnam) ended up being our problems later. ------ **myth**: the us routinely hurts the united nations and international peace efforts this could not be more false. sure, the us often goes against the un when its interests or its allies interests are at stake - but so does every country with the ability to, like china and russia blocking sanctions against questionable regimes like syria or north korea. but here is something to think about: the us may not be frequently involved, but it has provided more troops and lives to un missions to stop aggression than any other country. the korean war and gulf war alone has meant the us has committed over a million troops in the un's history to go along with over 30,000+ lives for un sanctioned missions. organizations like the un are toothless when it comes to major acts of aggression because the un can only keep the peace if member nations want to contribute and *enforce* those resolutions. if in 1991, the us didn't exist as a power, what country would have stepped up and fought iraq? the us contributed *700,000* of the 950,000 troops to fight iraq, more than double the next closest country (saudi arabia, which was a worried neighbor) and far more than the european contingent *combined* ------ **myth**: the us military destabilizes the world and makes it more dangerous a quick look at the history of the multi-polar world would tell you this is not true. world war i and world war ii showed how brutal a multi-polar world could be. had the cold war gotten hot, we probably wouldn't be here today. modern case in point: if the us were to withdraw or disappear from the western pacific today, countries like japan, taiwan, the philippines, and vietnam would all arm up quickly to counter the rising influence of china. many of them already have the capability to produce nuclear weapons - they would certainly have a good reason to now that the us nuclear umbrella and guarantee of protection has been removed. that makes the world far more dangerous. furthermore, the us navy has ensured freedom of the seas for decades now. freedom of the seas means cheaper trade, which has lifted up the lives of billions around the world who now have access to the resources and goods they could not once get, or once had to pay a lot for by virtue of restricted sea lanes. contrary to popular belief, the us does not get most of its oil from the middle east - it in fact gets most of it from canada, mexico, or is domestically produced. who does get a lot of it though is china and europe - and both of them benefit heavily from the us navy ensuring an open straits of hormuz. china is oil hungry and its modernization, which has lifted over a billion people out of poverty, could not happen if those sea lanes were closed or being taxed by regional powers.",cpk3082,1210.9807816203559,1,1426790537,443,43,9954,0,55.186698742322335,1578.0,2369.0,65.0,10,0.2923076923076923,0.015384615384615385,0.16923076923076924,0.18461538461538463,0.015384615384615385,0.0,0.0,0.1076923076923077,0.015384615384615385,0.07692307692307693,0.0,0.015384615384615385,0.09230769230769231,0.0,0.9846153846153846,0.05755845716783217,0.229404309252218,0.0,0,0.0,1603,81.43,73.57,34.38,16.80,24.66,20.77,83.97,53.40,11.73,6.36,0.37,3.74,0.62,0.12,1.50,5.36,9.17,14.78,7.86,4.37,6.49,1.50,13.10,5.12,2.99,1.81,1.68,2.56,5.12,2.25,2.87,0.19,1.87,0.25,8.48,0.00,0.06,0.00,0.12,12.91,1.56,2.12,2.25,2.99,1.62,4.62,1.19,0.44,0.19,0.37,0.75,0.25,0.37,0.00,0.12,11.17,4.49,0.81,4.49,1.19,0.62,2.99,8.67,0.94,14.41,1.31,9.17,4.37,3.06,0.06,0.19,1.87,0.06,0.81,0.31,0.06,0.12,0.12,0.00,0.00,17.40,3.93,4.99,0.81,0.00,0.12,0.00,3.18,0.12,0.75,0.37,3.12

t3_336d1i,"> 1) vaccination is a 100 year old technology based off of outdated ideas and modern medicine focuses too much on the symptoms of disease and not the underlying cause 100 year old technology - true. outdated - false. vaccination is based on immunology. to state simply (and yes, i am oversimplifying for the immunologists out there), for an immune system to work, it must fundamentally be able to distinguish the good guys (cells of the body) and the bad guys (bacteria, viruses). the way to most effectively do this is to expose the body to unique signatures of these bad guys, so most vaccines use pieces of the virus as signatures. that way, when the bad guys invade, the body knows to attack it. smart people knew that 100 years ago and those facts remain true. this idea that modern medicine focusing too much on the symptoms is not relevant to vaccines. vaccines get at the root of viral diseases and prevents them from causing disease -- it does not stop simply at symptom prevention. > 2) most vaccines work by injecting dead or mutated versions of a disease to train the body to fight them, and sometimes contain mercury or preservatives. this cocktail can either spread the disease, fail to prepare the subject for the newly evolved version of the disease, or the mercury and preservatives cause retardation. dead or mutated viruses - true. some are the mutated viruses are in fact alive (called live-attenuated vaccines). these are mainly the vaccines that can -- in rare instances -- spread the disease. this process is called vaccine virus shedding, most commonly associated with the live-attenuated oral version of polio vaccine which is not used in the us but still used elsewhere. the us uses a ""dead"" version of the polio vaccine which does not shed. the use of metals (aka adjuvants) is hotly contested and a simple search on ethyl-/methyl-mercury in vaccines will provide more information on the subject. nevertheless, metals are critical to how the vaccines work - most anti-vaxxers think it is added for giggles. adjuvants produce a stronger and longer-lasting immune response. > 1) the hurr durr facts, countries with lots of polio vaccinations do not have polio, countries that refuse to use the polio vaccine have a ton of polio. smallpox is extinct, rubella and the other one i forgot are also gone. even though i have no medical degree to me it would seem vaccines are a good idea yes, many nasty diseases have been largely eradicated in the world. i would add hpv and hpv-related cancers (of lady parts and the neck) that if we get our act together, a vaccine could be a cure for (certain) cancers - how frickin cool would that be? *sigh* > 2) the anti-vax arguments are based off the study by precisely one guy who has had his medical license revoked or something like this. this may be an ugly comparison but galileo was told not to publish anything anymore and put under house arrest for suggesting the veracity of a heliocentric universe and he himself faced a ton of disagreement by 'official scientists.' of course europe's governments had theocratic leanings at the time and it was 500 years ago. sadly this is only partially true. you can find a handful of very-often-quoted mds and dos that continue the anti-vax message. i do not have a clue why but when i talk to anti-vax patients, they continue to quote ""well there are plenty of other doctors who also think the way dr. wakefield did..."" jack wolfson d.o. who trained in cardiology (of all things) has some horrific interviews and quotes. doctors like this make it exceedingly difficult to make any progress with this topic.",cqhzep2,1427.814549061695,1,1429493240,19,8,2971,0,52.68526964822175,607.0,976.0,34.0,6,0.058823529411764705,0.0,0.14705882352941177,0.20588235294117646,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.4117647058823529,0.0974332906151088,0.2883031301482702,0.0,0,0.0,628,81.78,47.45,14.49,20.91,19.62,23.73,78.98,46.66,8.92,2.87,1.11,0.64,0.16,0.48,0.48,6.05,8.76,11.46,8.12,3.66,5.89,1.43,12.10,4.14,2.23,1.59,1.59,3.34,4.14,1.91,2.23,0.00,0.96,0.48,5.41,0.00,0.80,0.16,1.27,14.33,2.07,3.34,0.96,3.50,1.91,4.14,0.48,0.16,0.00,0.32,5.25,0.80,4.30,0.00,0.16,5.41,0.96,0.96,1.59,0.96,1.27,2.71,10.03,0.48,8.76,0.32,4.78,3.66,2.23,0.16,0.16,0.00,0.00,0.64,1.11,0.16,0.16,0.48,0.32,0.00,17.68,5.57,2.87,0.00,0.00,0.16,0.00,3.66,0.64,0.48,3.18,1.11

t3_2znn1r,"hi! i have been vegan for about the same time as you, and i found it staggeringly hard. i grew up in a family of five eating mostly cheap, processed foods, tons of meat and dairy, going out for mcdonald?s at least once a week. i literally had no patience or desire to cook anything that didn?t come in a box. it took until very recently for me to be able to be comfortable with my cooking and eating habits, but i have to say that going vegan has been the most incredible joy of my life. i understand that you haven?t had the same experience, but i really do think it makes sense to stick with it ? for both ethical and health reasons. i went vegan because i realized that if i was vegetarian for ethical reasons, i could not justify not being vegan. i take your point ? there is suffering inherently involved in pretty much anything we do. i do not specifically seek out local or fair trade products, but i still think it?s important to abstain from consuming anything that comes from animals. all we can really do when it comes to reducing, or refusing to be involved in practices we consider cruel is what is practical and possible for us. for me to specifically locate fair-trade, local, etc. products would be a difficult task ? i would have to change where i buy most everything, and find replacements for virtually all the products i buy or use. it is not a matter of being consistent, though. it is simply a matter of trying your very best. being vegan, to me, is very much within the realm of what we can easily do, because all it constitutes is avoiding certain aisles at the grocery store. i understand that it does generally mean cooking for yourself a lot more, but if i have made the change, i?m pretty much certain anyone can. it also, to me, makes sense because it recognizes that the very basic capacity to feel pain and will to live ? something all animals share ? inherently makes a creature deserving of a life free from pain.. those rights are so invaluable, human or not. they are the most basic rights we all naturally have. and all i have to do is spend 20-30 minutes cooking a couple times a day, or 10 minutes cutting up fruit in the morning. how could i justify not doing that, when it is that simple? i think what is important to recognize is that going vegan means changing your eating habits and attitude towards food every bit as much as it means changing what you eat. this is why i had trouble for so long, at least ? but trust me that *changing* those things is all that?s hard, you just have to get over a hump. if you have time to order and wait for delivery, or go out to a restaurant to eat, you should have time to cook. there is a lot you can do to help yourself out ? cut up vegetables and fruit in advance, or if you find you have time at some point, just make huge batches of things you can eat throughout the week. i keep like six jars of soup in my fridge. try to find very simple recipes, if you can ? there plenty out there ? and just stick to your favourites. curries, pastas, sandwiches and soups are all very easy to make. if you actually would personally like advice or recipes, you can pm me. once you have figured out what works for you ? and i am absolutely you will get there ? your life should no more difficult than it is now. try to develop a new attitude towards your food: because it is free from something that goes against your values, and also extremely healthy for you, it is nourishing you, both body and soul. and it is extremely healthy for you. i will admit that i know less about the health benefits of veganism than i do about the ethical ones, but i do know that there is a plethora of studies that link animal products to cancer, heart disease, diabetes, osteoporosis and a number of other illnesses. i think it makes absolute sense when you think about it: we are primates; we share 99% of our dna with chimpanzees. of course our bodies want a diet that?s mostly fruits, veggies, nuts and seeds. all animal products contain cholesterol. not one plant contains cholesterol. cholesterol literally *only* does your body harm ? no good. all plants are high in fibre, and not one animal contains any fibre. a really wide study (that i desperately tried to find, to no avail) just found that less than 3% of meat-eating americans get the recommended *minimum* amount of fiber in a day: 97% of the population is deficient. this was a huge profile of vegetarians (i.e. vegans) vs. non-vegetarians documenting a wide range of nutrients ? i am pretty sure it was by dr. michael greger and i can absolutely track it down if you?d like. it additionally found that vegetarians, on average, got 70% more protein than they need every day (along with meat-eaters). i am surprised that you found you are not getting enough protein, even for an athlete ? what tipped you off to that? getting enough protein usually just means is eating enough food in a day ? it is so abundantly available. have you ever seen the film forks over knives? it?s on netflix, and is completely about the health aspects of vegan vs. non-vegan diets. it?s a really good watch if you can get it. i don?t know that a causal link has ever been established between meat and cancer, but i know that there are thousands upon *thousands* that demonstrate a definite connection. the same goes for both dairy and eggs. i believe that it has something to do with the fact that all animal products are acidic, and our bodies are alkaline. acidic environments, i believe, are at a much higher risk of developing *and* of exacerbating cancer. don?t quote me on that, though. i do know that vegans have consistently been shown to be at a very low risk. i?m sorry that this was so incredibly long, but i really wanted to address each of your points in depth. i hope you take them into consideration. it is so good, once you?re on the other side of the fence. p.s. where the heck are your friends taking you that there are no options that can, at the very least, be modified to be vegan?!",cpkp3j2,1367.4666092217556,1,1426828612,92,16,7634,0,67.77861329902184,1099.0,1580.0,64.0,1,0.046875,0.0,0.140625,0.34375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03125,0.03125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.59375,NaN,0.21019108280254778,0.0,0,0.0,1126,42.90,52.49,53.87,52.42,19.41,16.07,86.86,55.86,17.05,9.59,4.71,0.98,3.64,0.00,0.27,7.46,4.62,12.79,9.77,5.95,6.39,1.24,16.43,4.62,2.40,1.15,1.42,3.82,4.09,2.75,1.33,0.36,0.09,0.27,6.39,0.09,0.09,0.00,0.00,16.52,3.82,2.66,1.78,4.00,2.58,4.35,1.51,0.18,0.09,0.44,5.60,0.44,1.78,0.09,3.46,5.86,1.51,0.80,1.60,1.60,0.71,2.13,13.23,0.62,10.48,1.69,6.13,2.58,1.42,0.89,0.27,0.80,0.09,0.00,0.27,0.09,0.00,0.18,0.00,0.00,13.59,5.33,5.06,0.27,0.09,0.36,0.18,0.53,0.00,0.00,0.53,1.24

t3_37131i,"i just finished a law test which included sentencing, so i could shed some light on why it is a bad idea. i'm no expert on the crime specifically, but i will start by discussing deterrence as a sentencing rationale. deterrence, for anyone who can't figure it out, is punishing more than someone deserves as a means of scaring others into not committing the crime. it is a good method, as huge punishments for petty crime generally do deter people from committing it (to an extent). however it is extremely unjust to give huge punishments for petty crime, because (in reference to your suggestion) you are giving them a sentence length equivalent to violent crime and even murder. if you can achieve deterrence then it is obviously a positive, as less people are going to commit the crime. but there are many problems with it, which is why it is almost never used and when it is used, it gets a negative backlash (look at the war on drugs, mandatory minimum sentences etc). it assumes many things - that the criminal expects to get caught, that the authorities actually catch these people often. if the apprehension rate is low, which it is for this crime, then people are not going to be scared of getting caught and the punishment will not matter. it also requires good publication of the sentences given, because if people do not know the punishment given out in practice then they will not care. it also arbitrarily punishes someone more than they deserve, which goes against many sentencing principles in western criminal justice systems. this is more for violent crime, but people usually weigh the severity of the crime over the length - so a harsher punishment will be better than a longer one. the biggest factor is that they do not expect to get caught, which makes the punishment irrelevant. individual rights are hugely important here too. i will discuss a few of the relevant criminal justice system principles which are consistent across western societies. * the principle of minimum criminal punishments. this ties in with the idea that penal punishments should be avoided if possible, because jail heavily restricts established individual liberties. deterrence goes against this entirely, as you are extending the restrictions on ones liberties based off of actions that others could commit. you are essentially taking punishment for what others have not even done yet, which is bad policy. * proportionality - the punishment should fit the crime. years of jail time are far more (taking into account restriction of personal liberties) than this crime generally deserves. finally, it is worth mentioning that courts do take into account aggravating and mitigating factors on a case by case basis. if swatting resulted in injury, an unusually large amount of resources being wasted or unusually large amounts of psychological damage then they would aggravate the sentence. if there are many crimes being committed at once when swatting then it could make for a big punishment. this is why some it crimes can amount to huge sentences in comparison to something which is seemingly worse, like murder. the it crimes are usually many crimes being committed together, where as murder is the singular sentence. **tl;dr** - deterrence does not really work. it relies on the fact that people expect to get caught, which they don't. it also violates many sentencing principles.",crizuk3,55.424185588272906,1,1432439664,115,16,18441,0,50.66642857142858,560.0,904.0,29.0,0,0.1724137931034483,0.0,0.1724137931034483,0.20689655172413793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034482758620689655,0.20689655172413793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1724137931034483,0.034482758620689655,0.9999999999999999,0.10842599860457004,0.23035714285714284,0.0,0,0.0,561,58.56,42.23,25.84,1.00,19.34,24.96,85.38,53.30,12.30,2.85,0.89,0.00,0.89,0.00,1.07,9.45,7.13,12.30,9.98,5.88,6.42,2.32,15.51,6.06,3.92,3.03,0.36,3.21,8.02,1.78,6.06,0.71,4.28,0.18,5.88,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,16.76,1.60,3.03,2.85,4.28,2.32,5.53,0.36,0.36,0.00,0.00,0.71,0.18,0.53,0.00,0.18,10.16,0.18,0.89,6.24,2.32,1.07,1.96,11.23,2.67,11.94,1.78,7.13,3.03,1.60,0.00,0.00,0.53,0.00,0.71,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,13.55,5.17,4.46,0.00,0.18,0.00,0.00,0.71,0.00,0.53,1.43,1.07

t3_37c5ei,"you make some good points, but i do not think your blanket conclusion holds. i mean, first off: > i understand that conditions can limit someones ability to easily lose weight, but considering i have 2 physical ones and 1 mental one, and still lost weight. i just do not understand. not everyone has the same condition you did. this is basically saying ""if i could do it, anyone could!"" ...which is rarely true. > the debate is whether people can control their willpower. if this is the debate, then i think science has shown pretty conclusively by now that people have very little control or insight over their own minds. there are entire industries built around this premise. it turns out that most of human reasoning is unconscious, that we make decisions *before* we are consciously aware that we have made them. this is pretty well established, scientifically -- if you wire a person up properly, you can actually tell exactly what decision they are going to make before *they* know what they will decide. your ""reasons"" for making the decision are often after-the-fact *rationalizations.* this is why advertising works so well. *rarely,* you can actually make a perfectly rational decision. most of the time, you do not have enough information to actually know which brand of toothpaste is the best value for the money -- and even if you did, the amount of mental effort it would take is worth less to you than the amount of money you would save. it is not even that -- you will not ever do that calculation, you will instead just *subconsciously* give up on the rational approach and just pick something. at which point, the [mere-exposure effect](means you will probably pick something you have heard of, like colgate. then, maybe you will say it was because you like the enhanced whitening or whatever bullshit is on the box, because you like to think of yourself as rational. and, here is the key, *you'll do all that without realizing it.* you will not remember that you have seen a colgate ad, you certainly will not realize you are buying it because of a colgate ad, but you are. that's you, that's me, that's pretty much all of humanity, except when we are putting a ton of conscious mental effort into thinking rationally. and that's a decision you make because of a subtle message you have heard a few times on tv or something. put the same lazy, irrational brain up against a basic biological impulse, like hunger or sex or even a craving for sugar, and it becomes *much* more difficult. that is why dieting fails. just telling people to eat fewer calories is about as effective as abstinence-only sex education. abstinence-only education does not fail because abstinence does not work, it fails because **people do not abstain.** the science is also settled on this one -- abstinence-only sex education *universally* leads to higher pregnancy rates than proper sex education. and, similarly, the science is pretty settled on diets -- the act of ""going on a diet"" almost never actually makes a difference in the long term, because people fall off their diets and gain back all that weight and more. so no, people do not have control over their willpower, at least not enough to make a change like this stick through willpower alone. > but in all seriousness, for all people who do want to loose weight. how can i help them (i forgot to mention i am a nutrition student) loose weight by dealing with psychological factors. first, do not take my word for the above. take a psychology course or two. read [this book](you are a student, go study. i am sure as hell not a primary source, and if this is going to be your job, i really hope you get better at it than i am. my advice to people wanting to lose weight would be: instead of picking diets by how catchy their marketing is or how strong the science is, pick a diet on this basis alone: how likely are you to be able to stick to this diet for the rest of your life? same for an exercise program -- and do both of those things. for example, [i like this](i know you have taken some flack for the word ""simple"", but simplicity is a big part of this -- it has to be *really, stupidly, painfully obvious* that you are cheating, otherwise you will say things like ""it's okay to have this donut, because i went jogging this morning."" to make it even easier, if you find yourself thinking that, you do not have to deny yourself donuts, just hold off till saturday and have a donut then. i'd start with something like that to reduce the *amount* they are eating, and then, as a secondary concern, make some suggestions for healthy stuff they could be eating instead. > what can society do?

t3_3hosv2,"women need a certain minimum amount of body fat in order to carry a pregnancy to term and then breastfeed the child. in fact, there is a hormonal regulation mechanism that pauses the menstrual cycle and makes the woman infertile if her body fat falls below a threshold. in the environment of adaptation, people were more likely to be malnourished than fat, hence males evolved a sexual preference to avoid investing time and effort to mate with females that looked too skinny, and females evolved to ""advertise"" their body fat by storing it in places where it is most visible in an upright position: the breasts and the buttocks. co-evolution between male sexual preferences and female body fat distribution created a feedback loop that reinforced these characteristics. therefore the vast majority of men are instinctively attracted to large breasts and round firm buttocks. it has nothing to do with ""over sexualization"", it is just biology. (note that this is different than just being attracted to ""fat"" women, in fact men are generally not attracted to women with an excessive waist-to-hip ratio, which correlates with poor health). as for the topless thing, social norms about clothing vary greatly between cultures: in some islamic countries women often cover head to toe in large burqas, while in some oceanian tribes people walk around almost naked, women wearing a simple skirt and men wearing only a penis sheath leaving their scrotum exposed. clearly, western cultural norms about clothing are somewhere in between. if you want to argue for different norms then you need a stronger argument than just debating the ""sexualization"" of any given body part.",cu9at72,281.4321214217075,1,1440065578,34,9,9646,0,38.33067647058823,272.0,453.0,10.0,0,0.0,0.2,0.3,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3,0.0,1.5000000000000002,0.1055230669265757,0.3786764705882353,0.0,0,0.0,275,93.84,77.75,12.79,38.72,27.50,26.55,85.45,45.09,6.55,1.82,0.00,0.00,0.73,0.36,0.73,4.36,7.27,16.73,4.36,6.18,5.09,0.73,9.09,9.09,3.27,0.73,0.00,2.91,3.64,2.18,1.45,0.36,0.73,0.00,10.55,0.36,0.36,3.64,1.82,12.00,1.09,1.45,2.55,4.36,1.82,2.91,1.09,1.09,0.00,0.36,10.91,8.00,3.27,3.64,2.18,5.45,1.09,0.73,3.27,0.00,0.36,2.55,6.18,0.73,13.09,1.45,8.73,2.55,1.82,0.00,0.00,0.73,0.36,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,13.09,3.64,4.00,0.73,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.09,2.91,0.00,0.73,0.00

t3_33ntp6,">firstly, i fail to see how this is truly harmful to people. there is a root of any trend, and i do not see how anyone can claim exclusive ownership of something just because it originated with them. look at fashion and music; there is obvious 'appropriation' there and while some of the original artists may not appreciate it, for the most part they are not claiming personal hurt. you do not appropriate music, you appropriate culture. >relatedly, while i acknowledge the 'power' issue, it is worth noting that european/white culture seems completely immune to calls of cultural appropriation. race does not equate to culture. european and white is too broad. you go to a neighborhood and look around you. you may see majority blacks, but whites and hispanics too. the people there are predominantly black, so the neighborhood is mostly infused with black culture. however, *all* these people grew up in it. the race does not matter. what matters is that they grew up in it. they grew up with the hip hop and rap, they grew up with the fashion, the vernacular and the mannerisms. now, say two people from beverly hills start taking *aspects* of this culture, picking and choosing what they want for no benefit but to put on a facade, for their image. they do not know why the culture is the way it is, and they are not looking to learn. they want to be in this culture but do not fully embrace *all* of it. that's cultural appropriation. >i have heard it argued that it is harmful because people 'want to look black, but not be black' that means: ''you want to be apart of black culture, visually, but you do not want the rest of it''. yes, that hurts people. a lot of culture is infused in history. imagine your family had a certain tradition. there was this pretty dress all of the women wear on their wedding day. the patterns on the garmet symbolize your great grandmother surviving horrible atrocities, a war perhaps. you now pass it on to your daughter who escaped an abusive relationship herself. this garmet holds solace and history you do not want to forget. now, what if some woman miles away stumbles upon a picture of one of you in the dress. she replicates the dress and parades it around simply because it is ""pretty"". other people copy this, knowing nothing about the origins. now people look at *you* funny at your attachment to this dress. ""it's just a dress and everybody has it. what is so special about it?"" *that's* how you can kill a culture. now, the people shouting ""cultural appropriation"" now and days, are sometimes shouting it at the wrong people for the wrong reason. that i agree with. however, are you okay with killing culture just so someone can *look* like they are apart of it?",cqmw53q,839.9309937060473,1,1429856574,52,6,15081,0,71.53269054178146,484.0,696.0,36.0,1,0.0,0.0,0.19444444444444445,0.2777777777777778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.027777777777777776,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.0,0.5555555555555556,0.08201814058956917,0.22520661157024793,0.0,0,0.0,485,43.22,84.88,26.99,22.57,13.47,19.79,89.69,58.14,16.49,7.42,1.03,0.00,3.51,0.41,2.47,9.07,6.60,12.58,8.66,7.22,6.80,2.89,15.26,3.30,0.41,1.86,0.62,2.06,5.36,2.47,2.68,0.21,1.03,0.62,15.46,0.82,0.41,1.24,0.00,15.46,2.27,2.47,1.44,3.51,1.86,4.74,5.57,3.71,1.44,0.41,0.62,0.41,0.21,0.00,0.00,4.33,1.24,0.41,1.65,0.62,0.82,1.44,14.23,0.41,11.13,2.06,5.98,3.09,0.41,1.03,0.62,0.21,0.00,0.62,0.62,0.00,0.00,0.62,0.00,0.00,20.21,7.01,5.15,0.21,0.21,0.41,0.00,0.00,1.24,2.68,0.00,3.30
t3_33wcrk,"it seems that you see feminism as the sole reason for the expansion of women's roles in society throughout the modern age, but i would argue that there is another force that plays just as important a role - the service-sector economy. back in the good ol' days (everything up to the industrial revolution and then some), almost all of the jobs in a community required some level of physical labor. because of their larger muscle mass, men were much more suited for these tasks than women. on top of that, women were pregnant a lot more often in those days, and having a pregnant woman perform dangerous and strenuous physical tasks is generally a bad idea. the result is that the vast majority of work was done by men. enter the service-sector economy, on the coattails of the industrial revolution, bringing with it an abundance of a new type of low-level position: clerical work. it is not by coincidence, or even by feminism, that these positions quickly became filled by widows and young, unmarried women. these were women who still had done, or were going to do, their ""womanly duty"" by having kids and staying home to raise them, but when they couldn't, they made it apparent to do what they could to bring in money and make a contribution to society. a few decades later, and we had wwii, and even more positions opened up that women *had* to fill (because, of course, so many of the able bodied young men were warring). though that is less a matter of the service-sector economy and more a matter of societal necessity, it nevertheless shows that the paradigm shift towards women at work did not come from feminism.",cqpacup,432.2716419996731,1,1430069991,145,14,10469,0,48.5936986062718,287.0,438.0,10.0,11,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1,0.0,0.0,0.1,0.2,0.0,1.0999999999999999,0.06214849964849964,0.27526132404181186,0.0,0,0.0,291,81.59,77.52,45.20,16.01,29.10,18.90,92.44,53.61,10.65,3.09,0.34,0.34,0.34,0.00,2.06,7.56,8.93,15.12,8.25,4.47,7.56,1.03,12.03,7.56,3.78,1.03,0.00,4.81,2.75,1.03,1.72,0.00,0.69,0.34,11.34,1.03,0.00,3.09,1.03,10.65,1.37,2.41,1.03,3.09,1.03,3.09,0.69,0.69,0.00,0.00,2.06,0.69,1.72,0.69,0.00,6.87,0.69,1.72,3.78,0.34,0.69,4.81,5.50,0.69,16.49,2.41,9.97,5.15,7.56,0.34,0.34,1.37,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,15.81,3.44,6.53,0.34,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.72,0.69,1.03,1.37,0.69

t3_32aahp,"so i am going to use [new york's rape law](as a guide to show why this is not rape. there are a bunch of classes of rape depending on exactly what happens. **rape in the first degree** is the forcible compulsion of another person to have sex with you, or having sex with a very young child who could not possibly consent. so when it is two adults, you need to be using physical violence to force them to have sex with you. it is a very severe crime, punishable the same as a murder in the second degree. the behavior described is definitely not rape in the first degree. **rape in the second degree** is having sex with a person who cannot possibly consent, such as an unconscious person or severely mentally disabled person, or an adult having sex with a teenager under 15. this behavior is not rape in the second degree, since the person could possibly consent. **rape in the third degree** is someone over 21 having sex with someone under 17, or someone having sex with someone else without their consent. this is the only plausible rape law to apply. looking to how ny law defines lack of consent for this crime, it requires >circumstances under which, **at the time of the act of intercourse,** oral sexual conduct or anal sexual conduct, the victim clearly expressed that he or she did not consent to engage in such act, and a reasonable person in the actor's situation would have understood such person's words and acts as an expression of lack of consent to such act under all the circumstances. the part i bolded there is key. the law looks to consent at the time of the act, only. if you consented at the time of the act, it can't be rape under new york law, with the only exception being statutory rape of a minor or other person deemed to be unable to consent. rape by deception is not a rape at all under this legal scheme.",cq9e47i,481.2738730308479,1,1428807190,231,25,4572,0,62.277624134520295,337.0,485.0,15.0,141,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.06666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8666666666666666,0.2149606971975393,0.20474777448071216,0.0,0,0.0,341,89.51,52.35,13.45,1.00,22.73,16.42,84.75,56.30,8.80,2.93,0.59,0.00,1.17,0.59,0.59,5.87,10.56,17.60,9.09,5.28,5.28,2.64,12.32,2.64,1.47,2.05,2.93,1.47,6.16,0.59,5.57,0.00,4.40,0.00,8.50,0.00,0.00,0.29,0.29,14.08,0.88,2.35,2.05,4.69,1.47,5.87,0.88,0.88,0.00,0.00,7.62,0.29,0.29,6.45,0.59,6.74,0.00,0.88,5.28,0.00,0.59,0.59,8.21,0.29,9.68,0.88,5.87,2.93,2.35,0.88,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.29,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,15.84,4.40,4.40,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.17,0.29,5.57

[source, starting at page 5.](2. as others have noted, ""liberal"" is a confusing word that can refer to both ends of the political spectrum, depending on context. but i am not sure that this point fully addresses your view. you correctly noted that many ""individual and civil rights"" are associated with liberal politics (as in, left-liberal, not right-liberal). there seems to be a weird discrepancy between rights that are associated with the left versus the right. the right to bear arms and many fourth amendment rights (for example) are associated with ""classical liberalism,"" i.e. conservatism, while equal protection rights or a right to gay marriage would be strongly identified as left-leaning. what gives? 3. [this article](is the best attempt i have ever seen at providing a principled distinction that separates the ""right"" from the ""left."" the argument is that the political spectrum is essentially a measure of how much energy a person devotes to defending against outside and opposing forces versus how much they devote to developing and expanding their own resources and happiness. to use a metaphor from the article, being conservative is like making choices that would promote survival in a zombie apocalypse, while being liberal is like making choices that would optimize a post-scarcity utopia. when you think of it this way, the problems in deciding what positions are liberal versus conservative seem to be much clearer. in times of relative peace, the conservative position is to promote gun rights for self-protection and to mount a defense against encroaching big government. but when a country is faced with an outside existential threat, the extreme far-right position is fascism, where citizen would be willing to throw away gun rights and other classically liberal rights in exchange for protection from a strong leader. in that case, the ""liberal"" (now left) position is to fight for gun rights, to protect an underprivileged minority from being stomped by an overreaching majority. at present, there is not a strong conservative narrative of an existential threat to most countries. in that case, gun rights tend toward conservative, because those are the people who feel the need to protect themselves from the rest of the world. by contrast ""liberals"" support taking away guns, because in their worldview we do not really need them, and they are just dangerous toys. edit: grammar",cqhpv4a,430.3384436364514,1,1429475638,62,12,16029,0,48.960629115143746,479.0,788.0,26.0,2,0.07692307692307693,0.0,0.15384615384615385,0.23076923076923078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.038461538461538464,0.0,0.19230769230769232,0.0,0.7307692307692307,NaN,0.302713987473904,0.0,0,0.0,491,92.02,53.26,44.46,19.68,20.46,27.70,80.65,49.90,7.94,2.85,0.41,0.20,0.61,0.00,1.63,5.09,9.16,16.50,7.74,3.46,6.31,1.02,13.44,4.89,2.44,1.83,1.02,2.44,5.50,2.44,2.85,0.61,1.22,0.20,5.50,0.20,0.00,0.00,0.20,12.02,2.85,2.24,1.43,1.63,0.81,4.07,1.43,0.61,0.20,0.61,0.61,0.41,0.00,0.20,0.00,6.72,0.41,1.02,3.46,1.02,2.24,2.85,8.35,0.41,14.26,0.20,9.78,3.87,2.85,0.20,0.20,0.20,0.00,0.20,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,18.33,5.09,5.09,0.41,0.00,0.20,0.00,1.22,3.26,0.00,1.83,1.22
t3_3curfb,"here is the important thing in my opinion: at least steve is something new. ellen pao was a known quantity. she was a massively unpopular and shitty ceo. steve huffman is something new who at least has the *potential* to take reddit in a new direction. the issues that reddit has are not with limiting free speech or monetization necessarily, but how massively poorly they were handled. pao clearly didn't speak internet fluently and had no sense of the community of reddit. she seemed completely incapable of predicting the reaction of the community and responding appropriately. steve, the *founder* of reddit almost undeniably understands and relates with the people and culture of reddit, and comprehends how it is people will handle certain changes. for example, there are ways to monetize reddit that do not suck and do not jeopardize the quality of the content. paid ama's, facebook integration, autoplay videos, etc. are all things that the internet notoriously hates. it is also where i think ellen would have gone based on her track record of thinking through a financial lens. traditionally xyz+ more $$$ in her eyes, so that's the path she goes down. but on a site like reddit, the consequences would be *massive* to do that, and probably result in a loss of traffic. so the point is, ellen pao lacked a fundamental understanding of reddit, and it led to her being shunned by the community. nobody felt connected to her on a personal level and she seemed like a money hungry cold person. a venture capitalist in a discrimination lawsuit is basically reddit's ideal punching bad. pao was basically set up for failure. steve seems to have less potential issues and would at least handle unpopular decisions more responsibly in the context of reddit/the internet.",cszctr2,414.0786547449979,1,1436586905,135,10,13873,0,53.67197767145137,297.0,482.0,19.0,1,0.05263157894736842,0.0,0.10526315789473684,0.3684210526315789,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5789473684210527,0.009259259259259259,0.32996632996632996,0.0,0,0.0,298,79.31,56.67,6.87,12.44,15.68,24.50,82.21,51.34,8.39,3.69,0.67,0.00,0.00,2.68,0.34,4.70,9.40,13.09,10.07,4.70,6.38,2.01,15.77,4.70,2.68,1.34,0.00,2.35,4.03,1.34,2.35,0.00,1.01,0.67,7.38,0.00,0.00,2.68,0.00,15.77,4.36,2.68,1.68,3.69,2.35,2.35,2.35,0.67,0.67,0.67,1.01,0.67,0.00,0.00,0.34,8.05,1.68,2.68,3.02,0.34,1.68,4.70,9.06,1.34,9.06,1.34,6.71,1.01,1.68,4.03,0.00,1.68,0.00,0.00,4.03,0.67,3.36,0.00,0.00,0.00,15.77,6.38,4.03,0.34,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.34,0.00,3.69

t3_2wcx6l,">i'd fund the business idea and fruition with my personal bank account and if my parents and friends wanted to, they could send some spare cash my way, though i wouldn't expected them to nor are they obligated to do so. with crowdfunding, i feel like you are essentially begging for money via the internet. it is the internet equivalent of standing on a street corner with a tin can asking strangers for change. most business ideas are not funded with people's personal bank accounts, they are funded with small-business loans from banks and then with venture capital. in both of those processes, you are going in with a pitch, a business plan, and trying to sell people on the idea that your business could work. crowdfunding just changes that from one guy in a suit sitting in a bank office, to a hundred different people sitting in their pajamas online. and here is the key thing: with most reputable crowdfunding services, you do not get a penny unless you reach the minimum threshold you set for making your project viable. is it begging? maybe. but begging people for money to make your business idea happen is pretty much how business ventures work. but let us address your specific criticism: >crowdsourcing is lazy in my opinion. running a successful crowdfunding campaign, as most people who have tried will tell you, is a full-time job. making the pr contacts, keeping tabs on people, and drumming up enthusiasm is a capital-j job. and that's even before you get to fulfillment. >my next point is, i think crowdfunding is a waste of time and money, for both the requesting person(s) and the people that give money to whatever they are giving money to. it is waste of time for the person starting their campaign because most people will never see their idea get off the ground. as of today, about 40% of kickstarter campaigns successfully reach their funding goals... but about 80% of kickstarter campaigns that reach 1/5 of their target reach their entire target. i've personally been involved in the creator side of a kickstarter campaign that successfully funded and then fulfilled its backer rewards. as a backer, i have backed 61 projects. i have received the rewards i was promised in full from 39 of those projects, received partial rewards from another 5, and with no reason to believe the remaining 17 will fail to fulfill their rewards. >this kind of stuff puts me off from the whole idea of crowdfunding because now it seems like anyone can make up any reason to raise a few thousand dollars and people will be dumb enough to donate instead of standing up against bullshit projects. plenty of people stand up against bullshit projects, and plenty more just do not like crowdfunding at all and do not involve themselves in it, and that's fine. there is an element of caveat emptor?and the more reputable services, like kickstarter, try their best to stamp out the more bullshit and/or abusive projects?but bullshit projects making large amounts of money are notable exceptions rather than the rule.",copowc4,1948.9206284446022,1,1424297908,31,16,1702,0,60.59494791666668,512.0,754.0,24.0,27,0.08333333333333333,0.041666666666666664,0.25,0.125,0.0,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.125,0.0,0.6666666666666666,NaN,0.25,0.0,0,0.0,525,80.28,72.25,28.12,58.20,21.88,23.24,87.81,50.10,11.81,7.62,2.67,0.19,2.10,0.00,2.67,4.19,6.48,15.81,7.81,3.05,6.86,1.33,13.90,5.14,3.43,0.57,2.10,4.00,4.00,2.67,0.95,0.00,0.57,0.19,12.19,0.19,0.57,0.00,0.19,12.19,2.29,2.29,1.33,3.05,0.95,3.62,0.57,0.19,0.00,0.19,0.19,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.19,8.76,0.76,3.81,3.81,3.05,0.19,1.33,9.90,1.71,10.29,1.52,6.67,2.48,5.71,0.38,0.19,6.29,0.00,0.00,0.95,0.95,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,13.33,4.76,4.38,0.38,0.00,0.19,0.00,0.57,0.00,1.14,0.38,1.52

t3_3acxa4,"because i surprised myself with how much i rambled here, **tl;dr:** people that color their faces to look like they belong to a different racial group might not be racists, but blackface as a symbol is racist. to me this post is all about words, symbols, and context. i think there are so many questions raised by your post that will not fit in this comment: ""does wearing blackface make you a racist?""; ""don't the speaker's/actor's intentions matter before labeling them racist?""; ""who decides what is/isn't racist?""; ""at what point does history stop controlling our modern conceptions of racism?""; ""aren't we limiting free expression by restricting certain kinds of performance?"" let me start by saying that i am sorry your friend was caught up in the crap-storm that is the social media hate-echo chamber. based on the story you told, i do not think it is fair to call her racist. i will also say that i totally get where you are coming from. you are saying that your friend was simply trying to portray michelle obama who is incidentally black, and did not say or intend anything racist by it. so i am going to take a stab at how you are thinking by walking through a question: ""is the word 'wet back' racist?"" i think that question alone does not lend itself to an easy answer. the only reason ""wet back"" is a ""bad"" word is because we associate it with a disparaging image of undocumented latino immigrants crossing the rio grande in texas. but if i get out of the shower and forget to dry off my back, i can exclaim, ""ah dammit i have a wet back,"" and no one bats an eye. everyone knows that's different than *calling* someone a wet back. i am assuming that you consider blackface as a symbol in the same light, and in a sense you are right. words and symbols definitely have meaning, but that meaning only comes from context that we give it. so it would obviously be way worse if your friend included references to michelle obama's race in her satire. but she didn't and did not intend to offend in her portrayal. so do intentions matter for context? definitely. you know your friend better than i ever will, but i imagine that she has not a racist. however, intention is only one part of the story. *we* give meaning to symbols, not just the person who happens to employ it. how a specific community receives a word or symbol is just as valid in considering whether or not something is racist. if i walk past a group of mexican americans and bemoan my crappy drying skills with the same sentence, they might mishear me and think i am actually using the ""wet back"" slur. it might take a really careful conversation to clear the air after something like that. the relevant community sensitive to the offending word or symbol has opinions and perceptions that are valid just like the speaker's and ought to be respected. so here is the point in two parts: **1) as far as words and symbols go, context matters. 2) while intention of the speaker/performer plays a role in creating that context, so does the reception by the relevant audience/community.** let's take this out of language and talk about non-verbal symbols. let us go big and talk about swastikas! imagine that a kindergartener draws a picture at school and he unwittingly draws the nazi swastika (as opposed to its incarnations in eastern religions). is the teacher going to hang that picture alongside everyone else's pictures? the teacher would probably not, and would hopefully explain that the symbol is bad and represents bad things. why is a swastika so offensive? on a physical level, it is merely two intersecting lines with two 90 degree angles per line. but it has come to *represent* one of the most atrocious moments in human history. blackface is a similar symbol. the history you cited in your post is really critical for the context of blackface. as you know, blackface itself is a symbol representing much sadder and more racist times in america. if you google blackface, you will certainly find references to that burdensome history and i doubt that you will find many neutral definitions that omit those references. i am not black, but i imagine that this history was evoked for the relevant audience when they saw your friend. regardless of what your friend did or said, the symbol was there and prompted the reaction. so your friend is not a racist for coloring her face to look like michelle obama, but blackface as a symbol is racist. i very quickly wanted to comment your question about actors and theatrical performances that may call for a white actor coloring their face to appear black. i do not know if you have seen tropic thunder, but robert downey jr. goes ""full blackface."" it is actually like blackface-ception. he puts on blackface to portray in the movie a white actor that surgically augments his skin color to look black for a part. if you have not seen it, go for it. it is a funny movie, but it was not without its controversy (google ""tropic thunder blackface""). robert downey jr. probably is not racist. that controversy just raises more questions that make me tired to think about (is it ok to put on blackface to portray someone putting on blackface?). for purposes of this comment, i think you yourself would agree that blackface the symbol is ""racist."" you concede that what your friend did was in ""bad taste."" i would agree. i would say the actions were in bad taste precisely because the symbol employed is racist. it does not make her a racist, and it does not mean that michelle obama is immune from satirical portrayal. it just means that anyone thinking about putting on blackface should know that they are in dangerous territory because (a) blackface is a symbol that signifies a troubled and racist history; and (b) the black community will likely react negatively to uses of the symbol because of its historical context. hope i changed your view!",csbkvf8,937.7204108700513,1,1434694493,40,8,10367,0,64.0599854651163,1032.0,1542.0,64.0,1,0.015625,0.0,0.171875,0.140625,0.015625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015625,0.015625,0.015625,0.0,0.390625,0.0531511257701734,0.21511627906976744,0.0,0,0.0,1045,47.60,61.31,33.65,25.77,18.02,20.57,83.44,54.64,15.69,8.33,3.16,0.67,2.87,0.96,0.67,7.37,6.89,11.39,9.38,5.07,7.08,2.39,16.56,4.59,2.68,1.34,0.86,1.15,3.83,1.91,1.91,0.10,0.67,0.29,10.33,0.00,0.77,0.67,0.29,15.50,3.83,2.68,1.72,3.35,1.24,5.17,4.59,2.49,1.05,0.67,1.34,0.67,0.38,0.00,0.29,5.36,2.39,0.57,0.86,0.57,1.05,2.11,11.58,1.44,9.00,2.01,4.88,2.58,1.05,0.86,0.10,0.19,0.10,0.00,0.77,0.29,0.10,0.38,0.10,0.00,17.03,4.98,2.78,0.38,0.57,0.96,0.19,0.38,2.68,1.24,1.15,1.72

t3_3g8u72,"i think its important to acknowledge that we do not have, have never had, and probably never will have a judicial system that is devoid of human judgment. a human has to make the judgment call of whether to press charges at all. humans have to *choose* which charges to pursue. human judges have a great deal of discretion over the court proceedings. a set of human jurors actually make the verdict. and then more human judgment goes into the sentencing. and thats not even mentioning any of the complexity that comes from settlements or plea bargains. given the realities of the judicial system, i do not think its crazy that a judgment call is made over whether to try someone as a child or adult. and while i agree that its probably almost always preferable to be tried as a child, there are real differences in how the trial proceeds. its not as simple as the prosecution just automatically inflicting a harsher sentence just by virtue of choosing to try the person as an adult. the trial still has to happen, and the standards and types of evidence that get examined are different. if you acknowledge that it makes sense to have two judicial systems at all, then i think its hard to argue in favor of strict age cutoffs. i appreciate the desire to remove human biases, but if you consider the wide range of possibilities for how people mature and develop, i do not think strict cutoffs come close to being fair either, especially since brain development continues to age 25. there are plenty of ways we can reform our justice system, but i do not think strict age cutoffs are a step forward. i think they basically just transform potentially biased human decisions into what are effectively arbitrary and almost random ones.",ctvyztq,136.90962265070502,1,1439052149,86,19,-20232,0,57.216338797814245,305.0,465.0,15.0,54,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.26666666666666666,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.2,0.0,0.8666666666666667,0.11722483865341007,0.2754098360655738,0.0,0,0.0,306,68.57,44.81,64.34,62.94,20.40,19.28,84.97,53.59,10.13,4.58,2.61,0.98,0.65,0.00,0.33,5.56,7.84,13.73,8.17,5.88,8.50,2.61,14.38,6.54,2.94,1.96,0.65,1.96,3.27,2.61,0.65,0.00,0.33,0.00,8.17,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,20.59,6.21,2.61,1.31,5.23,1.96,5.88,0.98,0.00,0.00,0.65,0.65,0.33,0.00,0.00,0.00,6.54,0.98,1.31,3.27,0.98,0.00,1.31,13.07,1.31,9.80,1.96,3.59,4.90,0.65,0.00,0.00,0.33,0.00,0.00,0.33,0.00,0.00,0.33,0.00,0.00,8.82,4.90,3.27,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.65

t3_3ju7qq,"i had a great philosophy education in high school, *through other classes*. algebra laid down a few foundational concepts in logic, and geometry cemented a lot of those concepts with formal proofs and analogies to how ""real world"" logic works. then in the post- geometry math courses, we used algebraic proofs to establish how different relationships arise between numbers and formulas. the point of this coursework was to establish the foundations for higher level math, but for those of us who didn't go much further in math, it laid down a lot of foundational skills in logic and reasoning (and by extension, common fallacies and mistakes in reasoning). contemporaneously with that math education, our science education started relying more on math (and the attendant logical problem solving skills). how do we tie together the known formulas and definitions to figure out the unknowns starts teaching the use of logic as a ""toolbox"" for solving problems. i also took a programming class in high school, which relied heavily on an assumption that we had strong logic skills. then, the rhetoric and persuasion type courses start building up practice in practical use of logic in non-technical disciplines. literature coursework starts exploring a lot of philosophical concepts, especially ethics, truth, fairness, etc. reading works from different religious traditions really started to demonstrate the importance of certain philosophical underpinnings in different cultures. we get to thinking about these things before even taking a formal philosophy course. by the time i took a formal philosophy course, i realized that it was just a condensed, focused version of things i had already learned in high school. i ended up majoring in philosophy, but i think that my high school education was already pretty strong in philosophy, at least as much as one could expect for students of high school age and experience. in fact, one of the most notoriously difficult sophomore courses in my major, symbolic logic, was made easier from my high school math experience. so adding a dedicated philosophy course at the high school level wouldn't add much, in my opinion. we should bolster the ""core"" classes to highlight philosophical concepts, sure, but the best high school curricula already expose students to a solid philosophical education.",cuslgqu,542.9644837914236,1,1441562563,32,8,30216,0,40.18947580645164,372.0,629.0,16.0,5,0.0625,0.0,0.1875,0.0625,0.0,0.0625,0.0,0.0625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.125,0.0,0.5625,0.13101925851925852,0.2849462365591398,0.0,0,0.0,373,94.06,48.93,78.52,56.13,23.31,30.56,83.91,42.90,8.85,4.83,2.95,1.88,0.00,0.00,0.00,4.02,7.24,16.35,3.22,3.49,6.17,0.54,10.72,8.04,3.75,1.34,0.54,3.22,3.75,2.68,1.07,0.00,0.00,0.00,4.02,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,15.01,5.63,2.95,1.88,1.88,1.34,2.68,0.54,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,15.01,2.68,2.68,7.24,2.14,0.80,6.17,3.49,0.80,16.35,0.54,11.53,3.75,13.14,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.27,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,14.75,4.29,6.17,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.54,1.61,0.54,1.07,0.54

t3_3ab48q,"sexual morality is kind of like immunization. how you behave, and what you do with your sex life does make a difference to the group. it is the equivalent of herd immunity. if i am to have a successful marriage with my wife, it helps if other people are in loving stable relationships. if you are in a loving stable relationship, why the fuck would you want an abortion? children are expensive but grow the fuck up. not ready? then do not have unprotected sex. ask any father in a stable relationship- they will almost unanimously say that their children are the most precious things in their lives. its all fucking sickening lovey dovey shit if you are someone in your 20s without children, but its true. my baby is the most important thing in my life and i can't imagine aborting the little one. i would give my life for my baby. back to abortions. abortions by far tend to be performed by single unwed mothers who have an unstable future ahead of them. instead of making it easy for them to have sex, abort, sex abort and repeat, why not make them value sex, value stability. we in our society talk about sexual behavior as if its some kind of god given freedom without consequences. having children out of wedlock has consequences. making abortion legal and easy has consequences. the politicians talk about how most of the economic gains in the past 30 years have gone to the top10%. do you also know that the richest in america also tend to have the most stable families? they also tend to be the most liberal and most religious. it is a fucking paradox that the rich liberals are also the most socially conservative. the poor people who end up being screwed the most by the liberal worldview where sexual freedom is touted is actually suffering the most. the breakdown of the american family unit is one of the reason why all our fucking jobs are going to places like china and mexico. and yes all of it does have something to do with abortions. summary: 1. ""herd immunity"". stable neighbors with families makes it easier to raise your own family. if it is easy to raise a family, you will not get a fucking abortion. if you make abortions illegal, people will think twice about having sex. girls will value stability over sexual freedom and sexual promiscuity. 2. stable families raise more successful kids. the breakdown of the american family unit and how all our fucking jobs are being shipped to china/mexicohas something to do with this. do you know why they work so hard for so little? because they can. do you know why there are so many other third world countries that are not able to compete with china/mexico? because the chinese and the mexicans value their children and value their families. i am not saying they are going to overtake us economically, but rather just pointing out that among the lower classes, the chinese and mexican lower class have a much brighter future than the american lower class because they have familial stability. their basic family unit is intact. they might be poor, but they have a healthy future. if you care about your future, and the future of this country, if you believe in science, if you believe in the environment, then you should care about sexual behavior and its effects on the basic family unit. you should be smart enough to understand that family matters. stability matters. every little bit matters. that is why we have a thing called culture. our culture is our shared experiences codified into social laws and rules. the family is the foundation of our society and if its not healthy, no amount of wars, stimulus packages, finger pointing between politicians is going to make us great. for those reasons, abortions should be illegal. this country is great that we can experiment with all sort of things, but abortion is something that has come and gone. we tried it, we saw the collapse of the middle class family unit, and this has to fucking stop. this is infinitely worse than high fructose corn syrup or the obesity epidemic. obese people at least can have children. aborted fetuses are dead. couples are wasting their prime of their lives aborting their futures.",csbjo4k,536.5918674171636,1,1434691568,298,27,38468,0,64.01661973239968,727.0,1112.0,55.0,1,0.07272727272727272,0.0,0.12727272727272726,0.07272727272727272,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01818181818181818,0.03636363636363636,0.0,0.32727272727272727,0.09287184009406235,0.21045392022008252,0.0,0,0.0,730,54.54,84.47,11.19,54.13,13.27,20.55,88.63,52.60,13.84,8.22,1.23,1.78,2.60,0.00,2.60,5.62,6.85,11.23,10.68,3.97,6.99,1.51,16.16,7.12,3.56,1.78,1.23,3.42,6.99,4.25,2.74,0.00,1.51,0.55,14.66,2.60,0.14,0.41,0.14,14.11,1.51,3.70,2.47,4.38,0.96,4.79,1.10,0.27,0.27,0.27,6.03,0.27,2.74,4.25,0.27,11.10,5.34,1.23,3.42,0.82,0.82,1.10,13.42,2.33,8.63,1.23,5.34,2.19,2.60,1.78,1.92,0.96,0.41,0.41,1.51,1.37,0.00,0.14,0.00,0.00,11.92,6.85,3.29,0.14,0.00,0.68,0.00,0.14,0.27,0.14,0.00,0.41

t3_3baq8e,"cultural appropriation means that one group took the symbol from another group for their own purposes. for example, nazis culturally appropriated the swastika from hindus. no group was using rainbows as a symbol at the time, so it was up for grabs. gay people chose to use it. they had to choose something so they went with it. i saw your post about norse mythology and the 80s/90s. first off, it is ok to use an old symbol if it is not used anymore. the nazis could have used the swastika without it being cultural appropriation if the hindus still weren't using it. few people today worship the norse gods, and even fewer people did when gay people appropriated it. finally, with regards to the 80s/90s, the only reason rainbows are/were a symbol of free expression was because they were used by the gay movement. while bright colors have symbolized homosexualities for over 100 years, the rainbow became a popular and official gay symbol in 1978.

t3_362xxo,"[the effects of caffeine on the human body are very well documented](and to describe it as a placebo is just plain wrong. while coffee is not the only way to get caffeine, the majority of people who drink coffee are doing so mostly for the caffeine. if you do not need the caffeine in your daily routine, then this would make sense as a reason that you do not need to drink coffee. i would also like to point out that different people have different sensitivities to the drug, so you might be tolerant enough to the extent that you do not feel any obvious effects after a single cup. as caffeine tends to be subtle, this is highly likely (especially if you have already been getting the proper amount of sleep). as far as taste goes, it is an acquired taste. i am a fan of things that taste bitter in general, so coffee is not that big of a jump for me, but most people do not like bitter flavors as much as so coffee may be a bit too strong of a flavor for them. there is also the fact that the majority of the easy to access coffee does not actually taste very good. the main objective of most coffee is to get caffeine into the body, and so it sacrifices taste to make it easier to brew in large amounts. the instant coffee that you reference being familiar with is one of the worst offenders in this area. it is specifically designed to be easy to prep so someone who is not fully awake early in the morning can get their coffee going without much hassle. that easy of use naturally sacrifices it being optimized for taste. >it seems to me like the most elite coffee drinkers in my socials circles tend to hate starbucks. maybe because they think it is cool to do so and are attempting to show everyone how much they know about how coffee should taste like. starbucks actually does not have very good straight coffee. their plain coffee tends to be burnt and generally over cooked. however, most of their products sell not based on their coffee, but on the sugar and cream that they add to most drinks. as such, it is a great place to get coffee if you do not like the taste of coffee and want to hide it with other flavors so you can still get the caffeine, but as far as people who like plain coffee, it is not very good. if you ever want to try what is generally considered the best coffee in the world, find a good turkish restaurant and order a turkish coffee. it is very bitter, so if you are not a fan of bitter you will not like it, but everyone who likes coffee likes turkish coffee (as a side note, turkey is one of the first cultures to regularly drink coffee, so they have some of the oldest traditions and recipes associated with coffee). if you are a fan of alcohol at all, you can try an irish coffee. it is like a normal coffee, but instead of adding milk, irish cream or whiskey is added (often served with a bit of whipped cream on top). it is one of my favorite alcoholic mixed drinks. >have i just had bad coffee? has my past experienced not done justice to an entire culture that is coffee? i think so. it is a drink with about 500 years of history behind it, and in that time some people have made it exceptionally good. however, as teh majority of coffee is served not for taste but for the caffeine, it is likely that you have not had any super high quality coffee before. the is also the possibility that you are just not a fan of bitter tastes in general, in which case coffee may never appeal to you.",cra9nj2,1958.2517608290236,1,1431718609,51,20,3984,0,65.77642857142858,658.0,918.0,29.0,40,0.10344827586206896,0.0,0.3448275862068966,0.06896551724137931,0.0,0.034482758620689655,0.034482758620689655,0.06896551724137931,0.06896551724137931,0.0,0.0,0.034482758620689655,0.06896551724137931,0.0,0.8275862068965517,0.1497481684981685,0.20364741641337386,0.0,0,0.0,657,55.91,46.96,18.75,60.39,22.66,13.55,92.85,57.99,12.33,5.33,1.37,0.00,2.59,0.00,1.37,7.00,7.31,15.07,10.05,7.46,8.37,2.59,15.07,8.83,4.72,1.22,0.91,3.81,4.87,3.35,1.52,0.00,1.07,0.00,6.24,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,14.92,1.83,1.83,1.98,4.72,1.52,5.63,3.81,0.15,0.00,0.46,10.50,0.46,0.46,0.00,9.89,5.48,0.15,1.22,1.52,2.74,0.61,1.22,12.94,0.76,8.83,0.46,5.18,3.04,0.30,6.39,0.00,0.15,0.30,0.00,0.30,0.00,0.00,0.15,0.15,0.00,9.89,4.11,3.81,0.00,0.00,0.30,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.07,0.61

t3_378zny,"personally, i agree that being in a simulation does not change much about my reality - i will still get hungry, horny, etc., and there is likely nothing i can do about it. however, i am not sure saying we are possibly in a simulation is ""nonsensical."" to the contrary, the debate's still out on whether or not the universe is deterministic, and even if it isn't, that does not mean you can't simulate a universe somehow with the addition of some random() calls. so, it is not a nonsensical idea, but it is not very useful for my day-to-day, much like whether there is a teacup orbiting saturn. that said, there are some theoretical ways to 'detect' whether we are in a simulation; one way is mentioned in the book [""permutation city""](in which a person creates a copy of himself and starts it in a simulation, making sure to seed the initial state of the simulation with a [garden state](which is a state of a deterministic program (a program that slavishly follows a set of rules) that could not have existed unless explicitly set by an outside hand. this way, his simulation could check and be sure that he was the copy, not the original. and, of course, if we *are* in a simulation, there is the possibility that there are exploits we could use to affect the 'machine' we are running on, or the state of the universe, *or* that the creators of the simulation are watching us and waiting for us to hit some benchmark. iaian m. banks' *culture* series has a religion in it who believes if everyone in the universe accepts they are in a simulation, the creators of the simulation will finally poof into existence and say ""you got us!"" who knows, maybe the /r/emdrive does work and actually breaks the laws of physics, simply because the guy who wrote the simulation we are running on forgot to account for integer overflows. should we always reject things out-of-hand if they do not mesh with our understanding of the world when you factor in the idea that there might just be a bug in the universe? at the end of the day, no, it is not explicitly useful. but it does provide a framework for discussing questions about the nature of consciousness (if we are in a simulation and someone hits pause, what happens to our consciousness?), the morality of killing consciousnesses (is it okay to shut off a simulated universe with people in it? does your answer change if you consider the possibility that we are in a universe being simulated?) and it is still a real possibility, as far as we can tell. so, it is not meaningless, it is just not very useful outside of a philosophical debate - which does not make it a bad thing to be ignored.",crkt925,612.8083150286146,1,1432604008,162,35,11796,0,51.31657796451918,476.0,724.0,18.0,3,0.0,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.7222222222222222,0.0,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05555555555555555,1.1666666666666667,0.06755368814192343,0.22478991596638656,0.0,0,0.0,485,66.24,56.56,42.04,52.87,30.31,19.79,86.60,63.09,13.81,6.39,1.24,3.09,1.03,0.62,0.41,7.42,11.55,13.81,10.72,5.36,6.60,3.51,16.08,1.65,0.62,2.27,0.21,1.24,3.09,2.27,0.82,0.00,0.21,0.21,8.87,0.00,0.21,0.00,0.82,16.70,2.89,1.86,2.06,4.95,1.65,6.60,1.24,0.21,0.62,0.41,0.82,0.62,0.00,0.21,0.21,4.74,3.09,0.41,0.62,0.41,0.21,1.24,11.75,0.62,11.75,1.03,8.04,2.68,1.86,0.82,0.21,0.41,0.41,0.21,0.62,0.00,0.21,0.41,0.00,0.00,18.76,2.68,6.19,0.00,0.21,0.82,0.21,1.24,1.24,1.65,2.06,2.47

t3_2yj9uv,"number one, this prospect is horrifying, even as a thought experiment. number two, a ""trait-pure"" society is actually, i believe, the opposite of what progressives imagine a utopia to be. this is because, for many of what we call progressives, diversity is not just a means to an end, but an end unto itself. by removing this, you create conditions that would likely repel most people who call themselves progressives, and so for them such a state would actually be a dystopia. number three, if there is a desire for homogeneity among progressives, it would be ideological--as in, they would desire all people be a democratic socialist, or communist, or anarchist, or whatever. because this is based on ideas, and since ideas are mutable, you cannot simply kill your way to an end state. the nazis could not do it with the communists, the ussr could not do it with the anarchists, and china can't even do it with tibetan buddhists, despite exhaustive efforts on the part of all of them to do so. even if you killed every single person with a certain belief, and even assuming no one would ever hold said belief in secret, nothing prevents someone from later on picking up this belief and having it resonate with them, whether through media or through coming to the same conclusions independently. number four, even if one were to somehow achieve a ""trait-pure"" state, it would not be sustainable because *new* traits for *new* identities would very quickly spring up. all you have accomplished here is creating the demographic version of a mass extinction event, where all the heterogeneous descendents that follow come from a handful of survivors. so for example, let us say you achieve a state where there are literally only white people--anyone else has been killed. my assertion is that slavic, irish, mediterranean, and other identities would then assert themselves and the world divides once again. many of these same groups, remember, were subject to high amounts of discrimination in the past, which only hardens identities, and there is no reason to believe it will not return once there is only white people. hierarchies would reassert themselves, and every hierarchy needs a bottom, and those at the bottom would form an identity, if only based around the fact that they are at the bottom. but let us take this further: not only have all non-white people been eliminated, all non-french people have also been eliminated. but the french are a diverse group unto themselves. so let us go further. we eliminate any french people who do not live in paris. but paris is, itself, extremely diverse as well, with huge cultural differences from one side of the city to another. you see where i am going with this. the entire premise of this horrifying ""utopia"" is flawed because it rests on the idea that diversity, and the identities that come from it, can ever be truly destroyed. diversity is contextual, it is not some absolute reference point, it is more how we look at a thing, versus a thing unto itself. the only way to truly get rid of diversity is to literally kill every single person but one. and even then, this is assuming this person does not have multiple personality disorder.",cpaevf1,543.0408326237969,1,1426010705,34,7,36062,0,50.27522506082727,548.0,864.0,24.0,3,0.08333333333333333,0.0,0.20833333333333334,0.5416666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.0,0.0,0.16666666666666666,0.0,1.0416666666666665,0.06802702128789086,0.22627737226277372,0.0,0,0.0,554,45.67,56.46,25.06,35.21,23.08,20.22,85.02,58.30,12.45,4.51,0.54,1.08,1.26,0.00,1.62,7.94,7.40,11.73,11.37,7.40,7.40,2.53,15.52,4.15,2.53,1.99,2.17,4.33,2.71,1.62,1.08,0.00,0.90,0.00,8.48,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,19.31,3.25,2.53,3.43,2.89,3.79,6.14,1.44,0.90,0.36,0.18,0.36,0.00,0.36,0.00,0.00,5.78,1.81,1.26,1.81,1.08,0.18,1.44,10.11,1.08,10.47,1.44,5.78,3.43,0.72,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.72,0.72,0.18,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.18,0.00,16.61,4.33,8.66,0.18,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.44,1.08,0.18,0.00,0.72

t3_3gri3k,">i fail to see this as a legitimate concern. not because i do not think some women would choose prostitution to survive (it would happen, undoubtedly) but because i do not see how this is a bad thing. if the woman's only option was prostitution, and you take that away, what is her option now? starvation? homelessness? while it might cause mental damage to a woman to be forced into sex, as long as it is legal, enforced, and safe, is not the damage likely to be far less than the mental and physical damage she would suffer being unemployed/watching her children and herself starve/living out on the streets/whatever else she needed the funds for? i think this is a simplistic view - let us be honest and not politically correct - providing sex services to strangers is not the same simple task as flipping burgers, cleaning stairwells and cooking, cleaning etc. having sex has impact on people not because of taboo but because it is the most intimate act you can have with someone and it obligates you to share yourself at least physically with someone else. the problem with no other options available is that prostitution is not as easy as other jobs. certainly it may be easy to please most johns, that's not the issue, the issue is that it is not an easy call. can you imagine yourself working for the sex industry and being required to do a certain amount of dirty things with whoever shows up, as your only option for survival? yes, it is better than being homeless but it is troubling that people need to provide sex services to survive. it is not easy. i actually have a friend who worked in escorting - the payment is great so it was overall a good experience, but she described as being harsh specially on the psychological side because it is not easy to have sex with strangers and do most things they require >if i argued that minimum wage jobs should be illegalized because ""desperate people might feel obligated to work them"", would that make sense? i do not think so. a mcjob is a mcjob, and a mcblowjob can still be a job without being intrinsically damaging to a person. one could argue that sex is still somewhat taboo, especially with strangers, and that the cultural ramifications cause shame, stress, and mental damage, but that's a part of society's problem with sex, not a problem with prostitution itself. the only argument i could think of is that a woman might be forced to give up her virginity to work, which i concede is awful and should never happen, but often does even with it illegal and if virginity and morality is the only thing standing between eating and starvation, i am reasonably certain illegality is not going to stop many/any women. i agree that it is taboo, but as i said it is not just that - for some people it is easy to have sex for strangers, for others it is not. being a man myself, i do not like having sex with strangers and i prefer to be committed first - it is a preference (before you ask, no i am not religious). for most people, having sex with anyone who asks for it is not an easy task. i am divided on prostitution - but i believe it should be decriminalized at least. my problem with regulating fully is that there is no evidence that it does solve the issues it promises to solve. if you are open to changing your mind, read this regardless of who wrote it and which websites host that paper you should take a look. most of all, my problem is that street prostitution, pimping, abuse and trafficking have not disappeared. yes, health wise things are improving, but do not you think it is curious that a significant part of amsterdam's prostitutes are foreigners/immigrants? do you think it is ok that the majority of prostitutes according to many studies start before the age of 18? do you think legalizing and regulating will erase issues? i am not exactly concerned about bodily autonomy or stigmas, but with the workers themselves. the fact you need to do something to survive does not mean that activity is good for you.",cu0uiw1,1595.623525641877,1,1439417610,62,12,4095,0,56.301115456238406,716.0,1069.0,30.0,1,0.0,0.0,0.4,0.06666666666666667,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.0,0.5666666666666667,0.04106248157972296,0.20810055865921787,0.0,0,0.0,721,32.02,40.13,8.13,28.08,24.03,19.56,91.68,59.36,16.37,6.66,2.91,0.14,2.22,0.97,0.42,9.71,5.83,11.51,13.87,2.77,7.49,3.88,19.28,6.10,3.19,1.25,0.42,2.64,6.66,3.33,3.19,0.42,0.55,0.28,8.46,0.00,0.14,1.66,0.14,18.86,2.91,2.22,3.47,4.02,1.66,6.52,1.66,0.97,0.14,0.28,4.02,0.14,0.55,2.91,0.42,6.38,0.42,2.08,2.08,0.83,1.53,0.97,14.70,0.83,4.72,0.28,2.77,1.66,3.74,0.14,0.00,0.42,0.28,0.00,0.55,0.00,0.00,0.55,0.00,0.00,12.62,2.91,5.13,0.00,0.00,1.25,0.00,0.83,0.28,0.69,0.55,0.97

(even that's kind of generous). at what point does the person decide that the money is not worth it anymore? is that point before or after when they feel like they are young enough where they can start their career in something else? does someone who go into prostitution hope to work in the same industry until retirement age? while it is true that low wage work is not great, it can lead to opportunities of advancement, promotions and pay raises. there are virtually zero of these in prostitution. on the flip side, legal prostitution means higher demand from consumers, leading more people to pay for it, and increasing hte number of people going into as a profession. while the level of damage each individual would decrease, the number of total damage would increase. the types of people that choose this type of work would be lower class people with little career perspectives that would make some money for a while, but over the long term, most would be screwing themselves over financially and careerwise in the long term.",cu0urd0,920.9260824143644,1,1439417976,62,12,4461,0,57.08825995433139,539.0,820.0,26.0,35,0.038461538461538464,0.0,0.23076923076923078,0.34615384615384615,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.0,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.0,0.23076923076923078,0.0,0.9615384615384615,0.047742440565969976,0.2634508348794063,0.0,0,0.0,559,72.41,70.44,40.11,17.91,21.50,17.17,91.23,50.81,11.27,4.83,0.00,0.54,0.36,0.89,3.04,6.44,6.62,13.77,8.59,5.55,6.08,1.07,14.67,7.16,4.47,1.61,3.04,2.86,5.37,2.33,2.86,0.00,0.36,0.54,8.59,0.00,0.00,1.61,0.00,13.42,1.25,1.43,2.15,5.55,1.43,2.86,1.43,0.36,0.54,0.36,3.04,0.00,0.89,1.79,0.36,9.12,0.72,3.76,3.94,1.79,0.36,0.36,12.16,1.25,18.43,2.15,8.59,7.87,6.80,0.00,0.36,3.40,0.00,0.00,0.36,0.18,0.18,0.00,0.00,0.00,16.82,3.40,7.87,0.00,0.00,1.25,0.00,0.54,0.00,0.72,1.43,1.61

t3_32s0yp,"the wire was not a character-driven show. it certainly had tons of compelling, well-written characters, but the narrative was never bolstered or hindered by the inclusion of specific characters (scept maybe ziggy imho, lol what a fuckin asshole). one of the ways that the wire kept its narrative compelling and authentic was how it blatantly refused to adhere to standard tv tropes. one of the most tragic scenes in the whole show in my opinion happens in the first season when wallace gets killed. this happens in the middle of an episode with pretty much no closure. most characters do not care about the death. this is intentional. the show is not about the characters as individuals, no matter how compelling they might be. i think this point is most forcefully driven home by stringer's death. with the exception of maybe omar, stringer probably has the most ""depth"" as a character. they kill him off because in the universe of the wire, this depth does not matter. it does not matter that the audience wants him around so they can see what he gets up to. his death sends a clear message: we can kill off whoever we want, because these institutions do not care about how compelling a character is. i think stringer's death actually added to the show in really significant ways and was the perfect plot choice there. everything you mention about marlo being kind of one-dimensional and stringer being a complex villain i agree with. and that's exactly why he had to go. i was not a huge fan of the fifth season (like a lot of wire watchers i am pretty sure), but the ending you suggest sounds like a total trope, and they very specifically avoided those to make a point/give the show a more authentic feel. killing stringer and eventually replacing him with the stanfield org was actually one of the most dangerous and compelling things they could do, since it is ballsy as hell and gives the impression that ""anything could happen."" i dunno about you, but i would much rather watch a show that consistently surprises and challenges me than one that has a ""final confrontation"" five seasons in the making that can be compared to star wars.",cqe44d9,619.3021373562117,1,1429171693,27,8,-22678,0,61.47828703057381,377.0,558.0,19.0,6,0.0,0.0,0.21052631578947367,0.15789473684210525,0.0,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.05263157894736842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10526315789473684,0.0,0.5789473684210527,0.04142416225749559,0.2519893899204244,0.0,0,0.0,380,67.33,42.68,12.89,21.72,20.00,20.26,87.11,55.26,12.89,6.58,2.37,0.53,0.79,1.58,1.32,6.32,10.53,12.11,8.68,6.58,6.05,2.63,13.68,5.26,3.68,2.11,2.11,3.42,6.58,3.16,3.42,0.26,2.63,0.26,7.11,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.58,18.68,1.58,4.21,1.58,4.47,2.89,4.47,2.89,2.37,0.26,0.26,0.53,0.26,0.00,0.26,0.00,5.00,0.79,1.05,1.32,1.05,0.79,2.89,10.26,0.79,8.95,1.32,5.00,2.63,1.05,0.26,0.26,0.00,0.26,2.37,1.84,0.79,0.53,0.26,0.26,0.26,12.63,5.00,2.89,0.26,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.79,1.58,0.79,1.05,0.26

t3_39jwup,"lets just go and throw the subreddit /r/mensrights right out. there is a lot of ""radical"" mra in there, much like the 'feminists' they often point out are the ""radical"" feminists. so. why do i firmly believe mens rights need to be addressed and supported more? it is a combination of anecdotal evidence and actual real world reports and cases that combine to give me plenty of things to keep me up at night. context and anecdote time, i am a 29 yr old male high school teacher. my parents split when i was 9. custody, divorce and relationship issues such as domestic violence are 3 of the big ones that keep cropping up for mra, and with good reason. my father spent nearly $50,000 20 years ago (aka, ridiculous cash) fighting to get custody of 2 kids. this would be into a new family with his then new partner (and now wife), where he had a job managing a store, and she worked in one, so a strong basis of support. my mother won outright, with almost exclusive custody (father could get 2-3 weekends a month, only with her approval). in the asset split, he agreed to 90:10 because my mothers lawyer was willing to push for 95:5, believing she would get it. in the child support ruling (what usa calls alimony?) he had to give a massive portion of his gross income to her directly, and for a 12 month period of those 10 years, it was literally 80% of his gross income, which at the time was the sole income for my father and stepmum. after tax, they didn't have much for a long time. that was a governmental policy issue, which has been adjusted a little, but is still terrible. that was after the appeals process, because full custody and 100% of the assets were originally awarded to my mother, even though she would end up a sole parent pensioner with 2 kids, one disabled. bonus, my father and stepmum were run out of town because of harassment from the town. they boycotted the store he managed (the only major food supplier for the town) and effectively doxxed the owner of the store until he had to let my dad go. i have had both sides of the situation explained to me by both mother and father in the years since (independently, obviously) and drawn my own conclusions from both their stories, as well as some people from the town i have caught up with since. i feel quite confident in knowing how the majority of the situation went down, even though i was 9 at the time. and facts wise, those figures do not seem odd nor to have improved much on the average. women still win custody ""by default"" in many places, and win it with much greater percentage rates. most importantly though, they win with greater numbers *when the custody is being debated*. there is a lot of articles that blame fathers giving up custody for the rates, but studies of contested custody show a discrepancy worth investigating. that's the divorce and custody from my side, and no doubt i have got some confirmation bias on that. out of about 10 divorced couples i know personally though, only one had custody go to the father, and in that situation the mother was sentenced to jail for drug dealing. but that's in the past, and i do not keep an eye out or notice it as often as some other things. however, an issue that does continue to affect me today are those around the views of men, especially the young and the old, around children. beginning anecdotally, my girlfriend was surprised to hear of my fears in this regard, but has seen it at times, but being a young male, potentially scruffy, at least while i finished uni a few years ago, and anywhere near children is often a ticket to frown-town, if not outright hostility. i have gotten weird looks walking my kid sister (half sister, dad+new wife 5yo) places. i watch mothers hushing children away from me while i browse kids toys to buy them for xmas. i have had students that pull ""what are you, a pedo?"" when i tell them to pull their pants up from way too low. i have been outright advised under policy not to tell female students to fix their uniform, in such cases as tying the waist-hem into a knot, doing up top buttons, or unrolling their shorts hems to restore their length. all school policy violations, but nothing that i am allowed to deal with, because i am a guy. i walk to the shops, past a playground, and have been yelled at after smiling because 2 kids were screaming at each other in a game, and one of them ate it into/over their pet dog. i have had grandparents (i assume) of a child in a trolley baby seat ask the cash register chick where security can be found after i was making faces at their baby (he started it). possibly unrelated, but their look of disgust when they caught me babbling made it clear i was doing something wrong, even though 1: my girlfriend does this to babies all the time, and 2: i fucking was not doing something wrong. i felt like shit all afternoon. this was 4 years ago, and i still remember exactly how i felt from the looks on their faces. the default position is one of ""i am a danger to children"". i am fearful of being found in a bad situation with a child, such as a boy crying and looking lost. i dread being the only person around who knows cpr should i find a kid at a pool or beach who is struggling. i like kids, i want kids, but i am not looking forward to the day i need to change a diaper in a family room with some mums around, because 2 of my friends have already given me stories about how well *that* went down for them. i have never offered to bath my kid-sister or kid-brother for my parents when they were little, even when both of them were begging my stepmum for me to do it. i could not do it. it feels... wrong... to me, like i am ashamed of being in the same room as them without clothes, and i fucking hate myself for feeling that way because i fucking shouldn't. it is only a niggling doubt, but it is there. the cream on that cake is that if i ever am alleged to have done something, if i ever am pulled aside by an officer of the law to be asked questions about why i was in the girls lego section for half an hour, or if a kid at work decides to stir shit and tell mum that ""mrbaggins was taking photos of my friends at the swimming carnival"" then my career is officially over. do not even need to be charged. i would be looking for a new town to live in, a new career path and a new circle of, not friends, but all those people you ""know"" like the people i play sport with or knew while i was at uni but hardly talk to anymore. but as a girl, the career option at least is not a problem. i can't speak to the social side, but it is hard not to by cynical when there is enough content out there for /r/pussypass to exist. yes, some of those posts are a stretch, but there is too many of just australian female teachers getting suspended (and not fired) for misconduct with students for me not to be a little jaded, when a male netball coach had to leave the country after being fired after allegations (not even brought to trial), and a female netball coach caught in a sexual relationship with at least 3 members of the team (and charged, and found guilty) was working in schools again 2 months after her trial. i should not need to be worried about whether two kids in a fight at work are boys or girls, but believe it or not, i am not allowed by the state (nsw, for the record) to intervene if one of them is female, incase i bump a boob, or leave a bruise when holding an arm. which brings me close to the wonderful slogan from my own countries government ""to violence against women, australia says no"". domestic violence is a common one brought up by radical mra and the regular joes alike. apparently in the us there are even mandatory arrest policies where the man is arrested regardless, then held until the situation is sorted. regardless of who called it in. more and more studies show up with dv cases against men being under reported, under represented, and underinvestigated. and to combine the previous two points, conviction of violence, abuse and harassment is massively onesided. not just in the sentences themselves, but the public outcry for both is hugely different. we have had 2 suicides this year that are relatively close to me (one in education, one in my hometown) where a man has been accused of violence (hometown) or sexual abuse (education), it goes to court, they are found completely innocent, and yet they are unable to return to society because of the media effects. other posts have elaborated on the suicide / self harm stats, so i will not say any more on this. it is also, again, not a topic i keep an eye on. all of these are terrible things that need to be investigated and resolved. they do not lesson the feminist movement, or egalitarianism (which is what i call my own viewpoints) in any way. it is not an us vs them, which /r/mensrights and radical feminists seem to think it is all too often. we can be improving all our lives at the same time. i feel like, as a gay man, that many of these things should resonate with you, at least to some degree, although it depends on the culture you were brought up in. having people making snap, hostile, opinions on you based on something that one, you have no control over, and two, should not fucking matter, is massively affronting. having policies at the place you work that affect you because of something about you that you do not control. maybe not. but the persecutions, restrictions, and often hostility from areas of life like that seem awfully parallel in a lot of ways.",cs46pqo,815.1600020227594,1,1434119298,95,29,25302,0,64.71134495641346,1752.0,2465.0,77.0,1,0.07792207792207792,0.0,0.2987012987012987,0.33766233766233766,0.0,0.012987012987012988,0.0,0.03896103896103896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09090909090909091,0.012987012987012988,0.8701298701298702,NaN,0.22659817351598174,0.0,0,0.0,1789,68.93,47.32,69.02,9.34,23.23,16.99,87.87,55.95,12.97,8.33,5.09,0.34,0.56,0.84,1.51,4.64,7.15,15.43,8.66,5.25,7.32,1.96,15.04,4.19,2.18,1.68,2.40,2.57,4.86,1.73,3.07,0.50,1.17,0.17,10.40,1.96,0.39,1.62,1.79,12.47,2.18,1.84,1.45,3.13,1.06,4.47,1.68,0.89,0.39,0.39,1.45,0.61,0.22,0.50,0.22,7.66,1.62,1.12,4.19,0.89,0.56,4.47,8.94,0.28,14.53,1.57,8.05,4.97,2.68,0.89,0.45,1.01,0.00,0.11,0.78,0.45,0.17,0.06,0.11,0.00,15.32,4.36,6.20,0.22,0.00,0.17,0.00,0.28,0.89,0.39,1.90,0.89

t3_35t2fe,"while i am certainly not a ""red pill"" guy, i think you are mixing up that kind of macho masculism with some of the arguments made by an actually affable mra. much in the same way that most people- online at the very least- are starting to conflate 'feminism' with the kinda of radical tumblr fem-nazis that undermine their cause, i think you are conflating a red-pill jock with an actually mra. though i personally prefer to look at the world in terms of humanism because we all deserve to be treated with the same respect as individuals regardless of arbitrary divisions of gender, sex, sexuality, race, etc... i can understand why there are people who prefer to label specifically as ""feminist"" or ""mra""- labels help to identify specific issues and causes that one feels strongly about, and your views in that matter. it helps people associate with one another. feminism began as a movement for advancing women's rights to be equal with men's, so that all people would be equal. it started by trying to fight for labour rights, suffrage, etc... and they have won on almost every front. the modern feminist movement often seems so radical and controversial because we are not fighting for big obvious issues anymore. the problem, as i see it, is that we have come so far that the lines are thin, but distinctive, and you have got a lot of people who either cannot see the divide, or refuse to. issues like the wage gap and the stereotyping of women in traditionally male dominated fields like technology, science, engineering, etc... should be fairly self evident; the only problem is that these things are often subtle outside of statistics. someone can easily see that their own personal it department has plenty of women, or that their boss is a woman, and then think everything is fine. and, when we exist in a society where your own personal earnings are a fairly private matter, it is hard to see whether or not you are inherently making much more than your female co-workers, or then if promotions and hiring are driven by sexism or legitimate qualifications. what might be statistically obvious on the macroeconomic scale is not always as tangible on the microeconomic scale- in every day life. there are, of course, plenty of studies that have tried to show objectively and irrefutably that there is sexism in areas like hiring by submitting identical resumes to employers and replacing the names for a man and a woman; even still, it is difficult to make people see what they have not experienced directly. further, because these issues are so political, the numbers we have are often so biased or inconclusive that they can be skewed in any direction based on interpretation. whereas a hundred years ago it was blatantly obvious that women were under privileged, still fighting for suffrage- that basic societal right to vote on how you will be governed- today it is not so clear, and this is not a bad thing! that we have come so far that the lines are often difficult to see is good! we have made progress! unfortunately, it just makes it that much more of a struggle to have an informed discussion on the matter without having to do your own extensive research, whereas in the past it was much easier to point to your wife or mother and be able to objectively say ""she does not have the right to vote"", or any other such issue. without such research, a lot of people simply turn to their own morals and confirmation biases, making any ""informed and rational discussion"" on the matter quickly descend into an emotionally charged conflict. however, the focus has always been so much on this idea that women have been subjugated and under privileged, that it becomes very controversial to talk about issues that do hurt the other side. you try to bring up men's issues such as the likelihood for a court to decide in favour of a woman in cases of child support, divorce, accused rape, how men are often belittled for being sexually harassed in the workplace... and it gets dismissed as being sexist. you have so many cases where rational arguments like ""innocent until proven guilty"" in cases of accused rape are called out as ""victim blaming"" because there is just this emotional illogical rush to immediately protect the ""victim"" regardless of evidence (which i find to be the epitome of irony, because is that not the damsel in distress stereotype feminists are trying to move away from?) so really, there is just a lot of animosity all around which has made everyone too exhausted to want to fight it any more. that's how you end up with these ""fem-nazis"" and ""neckbeards"" who misrepresent the actual causes and end up with people who have views like yours, caricatures of what the causes really are. we are progressing as a society, but sometimes it feels like it is just too exacerbating. **tl;dr: i think you have confused red-pill extremism with a moderate mra cause, much like most people confuse radical feminism (""fem-nazis"") with a moderate feminists cause. both sides are working towards the same ultimate goal- equality for everyone of both genders. they just happen to be working from opposite angles towards that central objective. feminists are working for fair pay, treatment, and rights for women in society and the workplace. mra's are working for those same things for men. they are two sides of the same coin. and both sides have legitimate arguments to be levied.**",cr7kjx6,305.7841344332701,1,1431510485,17,5,5081,0,49.18485219845516,935.0,1451.0,36.0,44,0.0,0.0,0.1388888888888889,0.5555555555555556,0.0,0.0,0.027777777777777776,0.05555555555555555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08333333333333333,0.0,0.8611111111111112,0.026581632653061224,0.24385026737967913,0.0,0,0.0,940,65.57,75.88,26.51,8.99,26.11,20.53,86.17,53.51,11.60,4.36,0.85,0.85,1.60,0.11,0.96,7.23,6.06,15.00,9.47,5.96,7.66,1.28,15.21,5.53,3.72,1.81,0.43,3.83,4.79,1.60,2.98,0.53,1.28,0.11,10.85,0.32,0.11,1.49,0.74,15.11,2.34,2.66,1.06,4.36,2.45,4.15,2.13,1.49,0.11,0.43,1.28,0.11,0.64,0.53,0.32,6.60,1.38,1.70,2.66,0.85,0.64,1.91,11.70,0.43,11.06,1.38,6.70,3.09,2.66,0.11,0.00,0.43,0.11,0.00,0.21,0.00,0.21,0.00,0.00,0.00,15.43,4.26,5.00,0.11,0.32,0.11,0.32,1.38,2.34,0.74,0.43,0.43

t3_39rlhg,"i actually had this [exact debate yesterday](over on /r/vegan, i am curious if you were motivated by that to post this? i will take on your argument here though. i have been meaning to look into this more in depth anyway. so i disagree with you that (1) does not matter. the only way for me to say that it is worse to kill a baby cow than an adult cow is to say that there are degrees of badness in killing animals, and that requires me to be able to say that it can be bad to kill an animal, otherwise i could only say that it is not bad to kill animals, and there could be no degree of immorality in that scenario. and i think you must admit that there are degrees of such, as my neighbor's pet dog is clearly much happier than a calf in a veal crate, and you have said that happiness and suffering does matter in animals. the question is then, does the calf suffer more than your average beef cow? now while i think you under-estimate the cow's ability to feel pain, i do not think i need to press this point so much as the difference between a veal calf's reality and a standard beef cow's. beef cows do spend time outside. here is an [epa article](on the subject. however, the outside they spend time in often does not have grass, and is only a feedlot. during winter they can be confined inside, and also confined a few months before slaughter to help fatten them up. they are most often dehorned as well, without anesthetic. however, veal calves not only experience all this, (94% of dairy calves are dehorned, while about 17% of those calves are given anesthetic. [page 109](there is no debate that dehorning causes pain.) but must do so *while being starved and confined in a crate for the entirety of their life.* so i think we can say that veal calves suffer at least twice as much as your average beef cow. duration of suffering matters too though. so how long is that miserable calf's existence? the mspca says veal calves suffer [for about 18 weeks](or 4.5 months before slaughter, and since the age of veal calves is such a contentious issue, pretty much all sources have the same number. i could not find any official data on beef cows, (or steers), but scouring around forums gives me about 18 months for commercially raised, non-grass fed beef. ([1](so the numbers add up quite nicely, 18/4.5 = 4, meaning steers suffer for 4 times as long as veal calves before slaughter. so the suffering of 1 veal calf is 1 unit, and a steer is 4 units. however, (and there is official usda data on this, thank god), we get about [880 lbs](of edible meat per beef cow, and only about [175 lbs](per veal calf. 880/175 = ~5, meaning per lb of meat you eat, you cause a 5x longer duration of suffering for veal calves. do the math and we have 5 units of suffering per lb of veal eaten, and 4 units per lb of beef. this is purely on a basis of duration, not intensity, of suffering... even though as i have argued above, we have good reason to believe that veal calves suffer more. so you would have to actually argue not only that veal calves do not suffer more, but that they actually *suffer less*, in order to justify the view that eating veal is no worse than eating beef. on top of that, every purchase of veal covers a negative expense of the dairy industry. if we stopped paying for veal, not only would the dairy industry lose its profits, but it would actually suffer, as it would still be producing calves, simply not selling them. whereas if we were to stop buying burgers, the beef industry would stop raising cattle, and would lose profits, but not actually go into debt. and finally, there is a great practical reason to consider veal worse than beef, once again, *even if the suffering is the same.* imagine i give you the opportunity to live in two societies. one in which it is considered just as bad to kill an adult as it is a baby, and one in which it is considered worse to kill a baby than an adult. i think it is clear that a society that considers cruelty to adults not as bad as cruelty to children would be a better society, for indirect reasons such as the need to protect children more, and the moral innocence of children, and by saying that there is nothing worse in killing a baby for food than there is in killing an adult, you are supporting a worse society, however rational your view may seem at surface. all things considered, i think there is very good reason to find killing baby cows for food more immoral than killing adult cows, even though both are clearly immoral.",cs61rw2,875.116596169673,1,1434304222,65,11,28302,0,65.64338293093768,822.0,1164.0,39.0,1,0.05128205128205128,0.02564102564102564,0.2564102564102564,0.5897435897435898,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05128205128205128,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10256410256410256,0.05128205128205128,1.1282051282051284,0.10483358016252753,0.1873479318734793,0.0,0,0.0,852,59.16,48.12,33.40,1.00,24.34,15.38,83.10,53.52,10.45,5.52,2.35,0.70,1.64,0.00,0.82,4.93,5.75,14.67,9.04,7.86,8.10,2.23,15.96,6.22,5.52,0.35,3.17,2.82,7.51,1.76,5.75,0.12,1.76,2.11,7.51,0.59,0.12,0.00,0.00,13.97,3.52,1.64,2.11,1.88,1.53,5.75,2.00,0.47,0.94,0.47,3.05,0.12,0.59,0.00,2.58,6.10,0.94,0.94,1.76,1.17,2.00,1.17,12.79,0.35,8.92,0.12,5.16,3.40,1.29,0.00,0.23,1.17,0.59,1.53,0.35,0.00,0.12,0.00,0.12,0.12,17.02,4.23,6.34,0.00,0.00,0.35,0.00,0.23,0.00,0.59,1.88,3.40

t3_34g2hr,"i might revise your viewpoint with ""fb is certainly not the ideal platform but can be an appropriate platform"". a public outpouring of empathy does invite a wide-spectrum of sympathizers - from true sympathizers to people who are only saying it for show. but that does not mean everyone on fb is insincerely remembering/honoring/mourning. that throws the baby out with the bath water. fb has been a boon for keeping friends that are not ridiculously close friends but more than acquaintances in touch. if tragedy strikes this group, i think unilaterally judging a well-intended (albeit informal) message of condolence as being in appropriate is wrong. yes, not tactful but a public outpouring from many people who are not in your vicinity can be uplifting to those who are grieving. i also do not agree with your munchausen syndrome by proxy classification. msbp is when someone with a mental disorder is inducing illness in their proxy (typically their child) in order to obtain attention, care, and support for themselves. while i see the components of a very loose msbp, i think this is more than a stretch. if you suggest that the recipient of the fb condolence (like survived relative) is being abused by the poster because they posted a condolence, that's not only out of the confines of msbp, it is a bit ridiculous. if you think the people who are insincerely posting their condolences and suggest they have mental illness because they are attention-seeking, that's also a bit ridiculous. if you believed this, then everyone on fb has msbp or munchausen's since posts to the public are to obtain attention/external validation. lastly, msbp is relatively specific to seeking medical care as a means of obtaining attention.",cquc4bw,258.1411765769136,1,1430434668,15,9,2791,0,50.32587412587418,286.0,459.0,14.0,6,0.14285714285714285,0.0,0.2857142857142857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2857142857142857,0.0,0.7142857142857142,0.055283605283605285,0.2762237762237762,0.0,0,0.0,292,66.89,74.25,29.73,20.58,20.86,26.37,86.64,55.14,12.67,6.16,1.71,0.00,2.05,0.00,2.40,6.51,7.88,13.70,10.96,3.08,6.85,2.40,16.10,5.48,2.40,1.71,0.00,2.05,6.51,3.08,3.42,0.00,1.37,1.03,14.73,0.34,1.71,0.00,0.00,14.73,4.11,1.71,1.71,2.74,1.71,6.16,1.71,0.68,0.34,0.68,1.71,0.00,1.37,0.00,0.34,7.53,4.11,2.05,1.37,1.03,0.34,1.37,13.70,0.68,7.53,0.34,4.79,1.71,0.34,0.34,0.34,0.00,0.00,0.68,2.74,0.00,1.71,0.68,0.34,0.00,14.38,4.79,3.42,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.37,0.68,1.03,2.05,1.03

t3_3cp5ze,"i study media representations a little bit and might be able to address the points you raise. you first point, that there are a ton of bad-ass female characters, may seem subjectively true but in the general demographic context of video games it is incorrect. there are certainly quite a few notable examples of bad-ass female characters but, in general, females are dramatically underrepresented in video games. a [content analysis of 150 video games from 2009](found that 85% of all video game characters were male. of the 15% of characters that are female, the ""bad-ass"" characters are most definitely the exception. and even the ""bad-ass"" female characters are often still portrayed in highly gendered and sexualized ways. so even though you can call to mind several examples of non-helpless female characters, the fact remains that females are dramatically underrepresented and non-helpless female characters are only a portion of the already small number of female characters in video games. so, i do not think saying there are ""a ton of bad-ass female characters"" is an accurate reflection of actual video game demographics. your second point will probably be the more difficult one to change your mind about. you doubt that there is any connection between the way women are portrayed in video games and the way people think about and behave towards women in real life. without getting too academic, i will say that every person can be thought of as the result of a whole bunch of psychological and cultural ingredients. some ingredients predispose a person to be a certain way and do certain things, while other ingredients do the opposite or cancel out effects. what this means is that it is never as simple as saying ""exposure to sexualized women will make someone a hostile sexist"" or ""exposure to violent video games will cause someone to be a violent criminal."" there are way too many other things going on to be able to make such a direct causal statement. however, repeated exposure to certain things most definitely changes the way you think about them, and these changes in the way you think about things then becomes one of the ingredients that makes you who you are and influences what you do. for an academic look at how we are all products and perpetuators of the society's we are part of the products we create and consume, read [this](so with that said, let us talk about evidence that the media we consume can change the way we think about things. in another comment here, /u/fluffhoof mentions [this study](about the psychological effects of embodying a sexualized avatar. as a contrast to the single study you shared about violent video game effects, a [meta-analysis of studies examining the effects of violent video games](found that playing violent video games was related to increased aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, and aggressive affect, as well as decreased empathy and prosocial behavior. there are plenty of other examples where these come from and they all suggest that the kind of media we are exposed to can have real effects on the way we think about ourselves, and certain people and issues. just because you do not become a hostile sexist or violent criminal after playing video games does not mean that they didn't have an effect on you. most of us probably have enough other ingredients in us that have to do with being egalitarian and reasonable and peaceful or whatever else, that the effects of exposure to this kind of media do not manifest themselves in obvious ways. but if you are repeatedly exposed to portrayals of women as helpless and sexualized, you will most likely think of women differently than if you had not been repeatedly exposed to those portrayals. and even if the only effect that exposure to these portrayals has on us is that we accept these portrayals as ""good"" or ""normal"" or ""typical of women"" or even just ""not unusual"" or ""not bad"" then it does a disservice to women in society by continuing to limit the way women are perceived and allowing the cycle of biased representations to continue. also, your girlfriend's point that ""you will not ever understand because you are a guy"" is absolutely true. you (if you are a male living almost anywhere in the world) have lived your life in a world where men are abundantly represented in real life and the media. not only that but men are portrayed in a huge variety of ways: in positions of power, prestige, and notoriety as well as in positions of poverty, shame, and powerlessness, and so on. the point is that men have long enjoyed a very wide spectrum of representation, meaning that when someone thinks ""what is a man like?"" there is ample information to draw from and one can selectively draw from information that portrays men favorably. women (and minorities) do not have that experience. women are underrepresented in most media and they are represented in much narrower and limited ways than men are. so when one asks the question ""what is a woman like?"" the information one draws from is likely to be more scarce and more biased and this is likely to contribute to

t3_2z350q,"of course one could take the view that all else equal, a society where the lion's share of unwanted births are prevented through contraception and sex ed to prevent unwanted pregnancies would be better than a society where the lion's share of unwanted births are prevented through pharmaceuticals or invasive surgery to abort unwanted pregnancies. this is in fact the view taken by just about every prominent proponent of abortion rights! after all, the name of the most prominent organization championing abortion rights is not ""you get an abortion... you get an abortion... everybody gets an abortion!"", it is ""planned parenthood"". the ideal society for these people would be one in which people are free to have recreational sex but the problem of unwanted pregnancy is largely nonexistent thanks to contraception and sex ed, with abortion available as a safe and legal option for the rare cases when an unwanted pregnancy does occur. the reason this gets lost in the debate over reproductive rights, making supporters of reproductive rights appear to be ""pro-abortion"", is that all else is emphatically not equal. arrayed in opposition to groups like planned parenthood is a powerful lobby according to which the root of the problem is not necessarily unplanned parenthood or even the lives of ""unborn children"", but *sexual promiscuity*. the ideal society for these people is one in which sex only takes place in committed (i.e. married) relationships between people who are seeking (or at least willing) to have children. these people are also proponents of ""planned parenthood"" in a sense, but by their definition the very act of sex constitutes planning to be a parent, so abortion, sex ed, and contraception are all to be opposed by these people on roughly the same grounds: that they all acknowledge (or even encourage/incentivize) the use of sex for a purpose other than planned parenthood. in fact, the shaming of non-reproductive sex in these people's ideal society would also preclude (or at least discourage/disincentivize) the ""give birth -> give child up for adoption"" route, since this would require potential abortion seekers to publicly acknowledge the unwanted pregnancy and accept the attendant shame. to the extent that exterminating recreational sex is an exercise in futility, abortions would still exist in such a society and probably at a rate much higher than in the ideal society of abortion rights supporters; they would just be illegal and highly unsafe. so no, in the real world fighting for abortion rights is important, because in the real world the vast majority of people fighting for abortion rights are fighting for exactly the society you claim to be seeking, and the vast majority of people fighting against them are fighting for exactly the society in which lack of abortion rights would do the most harm.",cpfnsmt,504.5722128050195,1,1426440189,211,25,48087,0,37.86430143088555,463.0,764.0,16.0,1,0.1875,0.0,0.25,0.125,0.0,0.0,0.0625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0625,0.6875,0.19677200577200576,0.22894168466522677,0.0,0,0.0,467,95.03,78.60,2.10,41.24,35.92,27.84,87.79,47.75,5.78,1.50,0.00,0.00,0.64,0.00,0.86,4.28,9.64,16.27,8.14,3.64,4.93,0.86,11.78,6.00,3.21,1.71,0.64,3.43,6.21,3.43,2.57,0.21,1.07,0.43,11.99,2.57,0.00,0.00,0.00,15.20,1.28,1.50,4.71,2.36,2.78,3.85,0.86,0.64,0.00,0.00,7.28,0.00,4.93,6.42,0.00,13.49,2.57,3.21,4.71,1.93,3.21,0.43,9.64,0.43,8.35,0.00,6.85,1.50,1.07,0.64,0.00,0.21,0.00,0.21,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,14.99,3.85,3.64,0.21,0.21,0.00,0.43,0.64,2.57,0.64,1.71,1.07

t3_30rmn6,"there are two social groups on reddit that are warring with one another and want nothing more than for the other group to be pushed out of reddit. the two groups correspond to the political left and right. whether they sincerely believe in what they claim to believe in is ultimately immaterial. think of these two groups as gangs and subreddits as turf. the strategy to cement control over reddit is to invade neutral territory (ie subreddits that have previously not been affiliated with the two social group) and adjust the subreddit's circlejerk through voting brigades, infiltrating mod positions, or just having a migration of new users to be in line with whatever political ideology the social group nominally believes in, which forces neutral posters and posters sympathetic with the other social group's political ideology out until the subreddit is completely populated with members of only one of these groups. the left social group is better known as sjws, feminists, or any other group that's affiliated with progressive or identity politics. their hq is basically /r/srs, and the word ""fempire"" can be easily understood as ""sjw turf."" i do not think i need to go into detail about subreddits that start out neutral or unaffiliated with sjws but that eventually fell under the sway of sjws, /r/srd probably being the example that everyone brings up. the right social group is better known as mras, white nationalists, and anyone who is opposed to progressive or political correctness. they seem to be less centralized than the sjws, but they have their subreddits that's completely deep in right territory like /r/theredpill or /r/holocaust. /r/metaredditcancer was a subreddit that was trying to document how much control the left social group is able to assert over reddit without doing the same to the right social group because /r/metaredditcancer was affiliated with the right social group, with many mods that were also mods in various holocaust denial subreddits. so why does /r/srs exists despite being [the most toxic subreddit](while /r/metaredditcancer got banned? my personal belief (ie pulled completely out of my ass) is that the admins realized that there was no way to fully purge reddit of these two groups and have decided that rather than have reddit eventually degenerate into a sitewide battleground between two groups, they decided to support one side so that even though reddit will be completely ruled by one social group guided by one political ideology, there will be peace. so why did they decided to pick the left over the right? simple. the left at their worst is some otherkin sjw who sexually identifies as a trisexual helicopter propeller and who insists on having people spell ""trigger warning"" as ""triger warning"" because ""trigger"" looks too much like the word ""nigger"" and zhe literally can't even. meanwhile, the right at their worst is someone who believes that the world economy is controled by world jewry, that the holocaust was faked by jews so that the american public will be sympathetic towards jews, which means that israel can continue exist so that the illuminati, also controlled by jews, can do more comspiracy shit before handing over the planet to their reptilian overlords. the first one sounds like a phase that some sheltered middle-class teenager hopefully grows out of while the second one sounds like some batshit crazy shit a crazy hobo will spout, and since conspiracy theorists are a big no-no to mainstream society, reddit cannot associate with them. so, they will take their chances with the refrigerator otherkin over the crazy hobo. i suppose i run the risk of violating rule 1, but i will say that you are confusing mods, which can belong to either group or just be a pathetic powerhungry mod who's otherwise unaffiliated with either group, with the admins, who want to be neutral but will lukewarmly side with the sjws when push comes to shove. and who knows what corporate interests and financial incentives lurk behind the scenes and sway the admins to act a certain way? i think my problem with the post you have linked is that it tries to craft a narrative with convenient villians while i believe the state of reddit is mostly a result of emergent processes.",cpv8tx1,564.3514020807091,1,1427694721,205,35,-18280,0,39.30886363636364,705.0,1125.0,22.0,5,0.09090909090909091,0.045454545454545456,0.22727272727272727,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045454545454545456,0.22727272727272727,0.0,1.1363636363636362,0.09233312983312983,0.25390070921985813,0.0,0,0.0,717,76.94,57.74,35.85,12.75,32.59,22.04,82.98,50.63,9.90,3.63,1.39,0.00,0.28,0.00,1.95,6.28,7.39,14.50,8.65,5.16,7.11,1.26,14.92,5.58,3.91,2.51,2.23,4.74,3.91,1.39,2.37,0.28,0.70,0.14,9.07,0.00,0.42,0.00,0.00,12.83,2.93,2.09,0.84,3.07,1.12,4.18,0.70,0.28,0.42,0.00,0.70,0.42,0.14,0.14,0.00,11.44,5.30,1.12,3.91,0.56,0.84,3.21,10.46,1.39,11.16,1.53,7.39,2.09,1.53,1.26,0.00,0.28,0.56,0.42,2.93,0.56,2.37,0.00,0.00,0.00,12.55,2.65,3.49,0.00,0.00,0.42,0.00,0.28,1.67,0.84,0.70,2.51
t3_3d0d6p,"a good twist is really hard to pull off, because it has to walk a very thin line. if it is too predictable, then it is not a twist at all; if it is not predictable enough, then it is just going to seem silly (e.g. if, for example, lotr had a plot twist where sam was actually saruman in disguise the whole time, absolutely no one would see that coming - but that's because it is a bloody stupid idea that makes absolutely no sense). so pulling a twist off well is a matter of feeding the audience just enough foreshadowing that they have an idea of what is coming, but not so much that they are bored when it actually happens. in other words, a good twist feeds more off suspense than surprise. i would say that the usual suspects is an example of a bad twist. it is a twist that ends up invalidating a good chunk of what you have seen. in other words, it is a twist that reveals that the movie has been lying to you. imho inception is a better twist, because it relies more on suspense than surprise. the possibility of being trapped in a dream is raised quite a few times. this sounds a few bells in the audience's mind: ""okay, not being able to distinguish between dreams and reality seems like a major theme here, that'll probably be relevant to the plot later."" so we have a sense, a feeling, that maybe dom is more embroiled in this world of dreams than he thinks. when we learn about what really happened with his wife, or see the top spinning at the end, it is a good twist because it is something that's been germinating in our minds for a while. we look at that and say ""aha! i knew that would come into play somehow, i just didn't know how or when."" hitchcock often spoke of the value of suspense over surprise. one of my favourite examples of this is him discussing a bombing. if you have a five minute scene where two people are having a conversation at a table, then a bomb under the table explodes, the audience is completely shocked - but only briefly. if, however, you start the scene with someone planting the bomb then sneaking out, and during the course of the conversation cut to the bomb ticking down, then the entire conversation people are on the edge of their seats. the dialogue is cast in a whole new light, knowing that there is something about to happen. moreover, it fuses in a bit of uncertainty: will the bomb explode? will they find it in time? if they find it, how will they defuse it? etc. a good twist is the same way. a twist that no one sees coming is a bad twist. everyone's shocked when it happens - for about thirty seconds. a good twist is one that is slowly and gradually introduced, to build suspense. people are fairly certain that something will happen, but they do not know how, or why, or when. for example: betrayal. you have got a film where a group of people are working to accomplish something. one of the people on the team is a traitor. a bad twist is one where, at the climax of the film, the traitor is suddenly revealed. a better twist is one where we find out part way through the movie that there is a traitor on the team, but we do not know who. this is still revealed at the end, but we spend the rest of the movie thinking ""hmmm, okay how and why will the betrayal happen? who will be the traitor?"" everything is cast in the light of this knowledge that someone is going to betray the rest of the team. we may guess right, we may not, but either way (if it is a good movie) we are on the edge of our seats right up until the last minute, waiting to find out the exact circumstances of the twist we already kinda know. tl;dr a bad twist is something that takes us by complete surprise; a good twist is one that provides new context, nuance, and depth to the rest of the movie.",ct0o5u1,1543.9038209826065,1,1436714706,34,9,5585,0,76.64124562937066,715.0,947.0,40.0,1,0.025,0.0,0.225,0.275,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05,0.025,0.075,0.2,0.025,0.9,0.10225885225885226,0.1902097902097902,0.0,0,0.0,716,67.60,59.38,65.09,54.70,18.84,14.39,88.27,59.50,12.99,4.47,0.56,1.82,0.70,0.42,0.98,8.52,12.01,12.15,10.34,6.70,6.70,1.54,19.69,3.07,1.82,2.93,1.54,1.96,4.61,3.07,1.54,0.14,0.28,0.00,7.40,0.14,0.00,0.14,0.42,14.80,3.49,1.54,1.40,4.47,1.40,5.31,2.79,1.40,0.56,0.28,0.56,0.14,0.14,0.00,0.28,6.56,2.93,1.26,0.98,1.68,0.56,1.54,11.87,3.07,15.78,4.19,6.98,4.89,0.98,1.96,0.00,0.14,0.00,0.00,1.12,0.14,0.28,0.56,0.28,0.00,14.66,4.75,5.59,0.42,0.42,0.70,0.14,0.42,0.84,0.84,0.56,0.00

t3_3ga0yc,"the problem is there are thousands of vaccines in the world, all with their own specific goal, their own specific ingredients and therefor their own specific interaction with the human body. saying vaccinating is a bad idea because some may or may not cause negative side effects is akin to saying that eating is a bad idea because some people have bad reactions to certain foods. it is nonsensical. yes, there are undoubtebly some horror stories out there about cases where vaccination may or may not have played a role. and that is absolutely sad and horrible for the parents involved. but the inevitable result of introducing a foreign object (the vaccine) into the human body is that somebody, somewhere is going to have an adverse reaction to this. in the end, life itself is inherently risky and we can never eliminate all risks. i myself am terribly allergic to walnuts. give me a handful and i will be dead before you can call an ambulance. in the us alone it is estimated there are over 15 million people with food allergies (1 in 20), yet how many parents will have their children tested before giving them their first peanut butter? i would guess none. why? because the risk is thought to be minimal. yes, there might be countless horror stories, and some of these might even be true, but billions of people have been vaccinated over the years. compared to that number, even if all these stories are true, means that there is virtually no risk whatsoever. a child is far more likely to die from eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich than from getting complications from vaccinations. now a lot has already been said about the actual health dangers to vaccinations, i could add to it, but instead i will direct you to a very informative video by potholer54: [health, vaccinations and junk science]((potholer54 is a journalist who regularly makes videos debunking junk science, i suggest you check out his channel).",ctwe0ok,122.36748413574972,1,1439083318,26,11,-10858,0,56.72189976897107,331.0,510.0,17.0,3,0.0,0.0,0.4117647058823529,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.058823529411764705,0.0,0.0,1.4705882352941175,0.012053571428571427,0.27794561933534745,0.0,0,0.0,335,52.28,69.41,11.30,1.13,19.71,22.09,87.76,54.63,10.45,5.97,2.39,0.60,0.90,0.30,1.79,4.18,7.16,11.04,13.13,7.16,5.37,1.79,17.31,4.18,1.49,1.19,2.09,3.58,6.27,1.49,4.78,2.09,0.00,0.60,10.75,0.60,0.00,0.00,0.30,17.91,2.09,3.58,1.19,5.67,3.88,2.99,2.39,0.60,0.90,0.30,4.18,0.60,1.49,0.00,2.09,6.57,1.49,0.60,1.19,0.90,2.69,1.79,11.34,2.99,7.76,0.30,4.48,2.99,1.19,1.19,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.60,0.90,0.00,0.00,0.90,0.00,0.00,12.54,4.48,4.48,0.30,0.00,0.60,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,2.09,0.60

t3_2yrv0y,"the true crux of the matter is while in most cases it really will not matter--people will just do their business and leave--there will a number of times in which it does. and those few times make all the difference. rapes (and in many cases, sexual assaults) are crimes of opportunity. bathrooms are by their very nature exclusionary places. the risk factors continue to mount with the inclusion of alcohol and drugs, so restaurants/bars/events(/walmart for us americans) have added factors. it gets late or simply is not busy, and someone goes to the loo. currently, they will go to their own gender's bathroom. let us instead say they go to a new communal one instead. they are there with a friend, or at least someone who they thought was just a friend. in reality, they have had an unhealthy crush on the other for years. in the past, they would be violating a number of social norms that could possibly be noticed in the process. they would go to the opposite sex's bathroom, an act that could be noticed by anyone in the immediate vicinity. they would have to assume noone else was in the restroom at the time, while instead they could now check without raising an eyebrow. they would have to remain undetected by the victim until they could do whatever it is that they had in mind (rape, peepshow, some other twisted fantasy that i have not the time nor the stomach to come up with), where now, even if they notice them, they might not think anything of it until its too late. this all adds risk to the process of doing the deed, and in many would be predators, thankfully, is enough to keep them on the straight and narrow. removing these barriers for entry makes it increasingly likely that an opportunity for them to actually execute a plan/fantasy will arise. going further into the bar/club issue, 2 additional risk factors are having someone spiking your drink, or simply getting a bit too tipsy comes with an added risk at the bar itself. it is not seen as normal for a guy to go into a girl's bathroom with a girl who's sick at the moment. genderless bathrooms, and that friend can now take her into a stall, lock the door behind them, and have people think he has being ""so sweet."" in many cases, the guy will be. in other cases, the guy now can do whatever he wants to the girl. this is not even touching on the advances in technology that allow for increasingly small cameras to be brought into stalls. it would probably necessitate hard barriers in between them as opposed to the floating ones that are popular atm in the states (not sure if it is the same out your way op) again, currently, wtf you doing in here perv?!? after combining, you have to actively catch someone doing it. the risks will (hopefully) still be small, but if the instances of sexual assaults in bathrooms rises from say .01% to .1 or 1% (spitballed numbers); while most of the general public might not be affected, i doubt that will be much condolence to one of the victims. this will open up the business to lawsuits, bad press, and criminal investigations. at that point, places with public restrooms will simply look at it from a business perspective. the risk/reward for desegregation is going to much worse than what savings you would get from combining the two (because you would still need a similar number of stalls, the number of people using the facilities will not be dropping, you will just have more space to put them.) edit: after reading a lot more of the buried comments, i am wondering how much of this is not simply a cultural thing between the us and europe. guys on this side of the pond are brought up in a culture of hypermachoism that tends to lead to a lot of the differences brought up here. additionally, another prospect that i had not initially considered was in middle/high schools (or your equivalent). considering how ruthless kids can be as it is, the maturity levels involved here makes me wonder if they could handle that responsibility, and given how kids are having sex earlier and earlier, i wonder if it would become an even greater issue for the schools edit 2: fixing derp.",cpcgnrg,582.1016984651756,1,1426166880,483,45,17005,0,61.80381731000725,733.0,1067.0,34.0,3,0.029411764705882353,0.0,0.17647058823529413,0.2647058823529412,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029411764705882353,0.0,0.14705882352941177,0.0,0.6470588235294118,0.03816848135029952,0.2305593451568895,0.0,0,0.0,747,71.10,62.60,39.54,16.23,23.34,17.94,88.76,58.77,12.85,5.89,0.80,0.40,1.07,0.40,3.21,6.96,9.10,14.73,11.65,5.09,5.22,1.74,17.67,5.35,2.95,1.34,1.07,2.95,4.15,1.74,2.41,0.94,0.67,0.00,9.50,0.00,0.94,0.54,0.80,13.52,1.87,1.47,2.95,4.28,0.54,5.09,1.20,0.40,0.27,0.40,2.41,0.27,0.54,0.80,0.94,6.29,1.20,0.80,2.28,1.47,1.20,2.54,11.11,2.68,14.99,2.95,7.63,4.55,1.61,2.01,0.94,0.80,0.00,0.13,0.40,0.13,0.40,0.00,0.00,0.00,14.86,4.15,5.22,0.27,0.13,0.27,0.13,0.54,0.27,0.54,2.14,1.20

t3_2yrv0y,"after thinking about it further (pretty sure my other post got buried), i think schools probably provide the biggest stumbling block currently. not as much for the gender/sex issues that would arise from putting kids together at a young age, but more for the problems that it would cause the school: 1. potential for upsetting parents who do not agree with the merge. not the most intellectual reason, but certainly provides a use for the school board. angry parents tend to be the most obnoxious on the job hazard people who work in schools have to deal with. 2. potential for bullying and pranks on the opposite sex as well. kids can be mean for a myriad of reasons, and being different is high on that list. 3. raging hormones and tightly enclosed spaces. sure, they will probably have sex at some point anyways, but there is no need to help facilitate it during school hours. 4. all the other issues that have been laid out above. the real question is can the schools legitimately put students at risk while they are still at a developing age. parents lose their minds over the simplest things. having their daughter raped at school would certainly be one of the more valid ones to do so.",cpclzng,141.4555481101156,1,1426178131,483,45,28256,0,73.35550986842108,209.0,297.0,16.0,3,0.0,0.0,0.25,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0625,0.0,0.5625,0.01574074074074074,0.3157894736842105,0.0,0,0.0,214,87.09,53.74,50.19,18.85,13.38,18.69,89.72,50.47,8.41,2.80,0.93,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.87,5.61,8.88,14.95,9.81,3.74,4.67,1.87,14.02,7.48,5.14,0.93,2.34,3.27,7.94,3.74,4.21,0.93,1.87,0.47,8.41,1.87,0.00,0.47,0.00,16.82,2.80,1.87,2.34,4.21,2.34,4.67,0.47,0.00,0.00,0.47,2.34,0.00,0.47,1.87,0.00,9.35,2.34,1.87,3.74,0.47,1.87,1.40,11.21,1.40,14.95,1.40,8.88,4.21,5.14,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.47,1.40,0.00,0.00,0.47,0.47,0.47,12.15,7.48,2.80,0.47,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.93,0.47

t3_35y0qf,"and yet this thread is going to require semantics to argue against. so here we go. of course there is always going to be one or two opinions out there that are ethically correct and thus there is no moral argument against them. i doubt there is a proof of nonexistence of an ethically correct opinion. so the result is that the statement of this cmv is utterly useless. so the meaningful question is not the one of existence. i think you actually state it as fact so i will say no more about existence. the actual meaningful questions are which opinions are ethically correct, and how do i change an opinion? what if i think that exercising free will, failing to procreate, or just being gay is unethical? well it is the job of the subreddit to change that. how? opinions do not come from nowhere (most of them at least). usually you start from a core value and follows a bunch of if then statements. eg do not do to others what you wouldn't want done to you which leads nicely into something like the ten commandments (past the third at least) into most widely agreed upon opinions. and if someone holds a core value close (gay people are the scum of the earth) you are not going to be able to change that, especially not over the internet. (note that other not as scummy opinions such as murder is wrong and nickelback sucks should be included in the set of closely held core values). you will never be able to convince that person that gay people are awesome. the point of all this is to say you will not get a good constructive proof of what they are wrong. so there are only really two ways to attack someone's view: the best tool you have is going to be proof by contradiction, which is pretty semantic once you think about it. but most arguments of this type are going to be responded to with either calling it slippery slope or reduction ad absurdum (whatever the exact name was). these labels are not always wrong and so these types of arguments are not always easy to make. the easy way is to argue semantics. why argue the main point when you can take a badly phrased part of the argument, which may or may not be insignificant to the view, and argue that instead? you know like i have been doing so far? only the first 4 sentences have been about existence of ethically correct arguments and the use of semantics to argue them. a little has gone into what constitutes a proper argument. the rest has been making up some question you didn't ask, hoping to change a view you may or may not have had. but did it get you to start thinking more closely about your view? possibly instill some doubt? because a view is wrong only if part of the view is wrong. (i do not believe the converse to be true). to convince someone their view is wrong you must first convince them part of their view is wrong. semantics is an easy way to do that. once you see what gives you have a better idea of how to proceed.",cr8wgnx,433.0362349419845,1,1431617521,90,15,3041,0,73.58112673405742,547.0,756.0,34.0,0,0.058823529411764705,0.029411764705882353,0.14705882352941177,0.35294117647058826,0.0,0.029411764705882353,0.0,0.058823529411764705,0.029411764705882353,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029411764705882353,0.0,0.7352941176470589,0.03932178932178932,0.19012797074954296,0.0,0,0.0,548,43.96,60.80,31.25,5.92,16.12,15.88,90.33,58.58,12.77,6.02,1.28,0.18,3.28,0.00,1.28,6.75,7.12,12.77,13.32,6.57,6.57,3.28,18.98,5.66,2.74,2.74,2.01,2.74,8.03,3.10,4.93,0.36,2.74,0.36,9.85,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,19.34,3.10,2.74,1.64,6.02,3.28,5.84,2.01,1.64,0.36,0.00,0.73,0.00,0.18,0.55,0.00,5.66,0.36,1.46,2.01,1.09,1.82,2.19,13.50,2.74,9.49,2.55,4.01,2.92,0.91,0.18,0.00,0.36,0.18,0.18,0.55,0.18,0.00,0.18,0.18,0.00,10.58,4.93,1.46,0.18,0.00,1.28,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.55,2.19,0.00

[this article](talks about the parts of the brain that *do* change based on hormone therapy. if someone's brain is not especially solidified because of the aplasitc parts being somewhere in the middle, then slight hormone fluctuations could well switch identity from one side to another. i am not saying that that *is* how it works, since it is not a thing that has been studied all that much, but it is certainly well within the realm of possibility based on what we do know about gender. androgyny is based on appearance, and not identity. agender is a thing, but it is not the same as gender fluid. trans people do not or can't always get genital surgery, this does not make them any less of a man or woman than any other man or woman with a condition that caused them to lose their genitals. the 'man changing in front of little girls' thing is a pretty big stereotype that does not really happen. stalls are a thing, and most gender non-conforming people are well aware of the shape of their bodies, and bladder issues are a pretty big issue for a lot of trans people who have to hold their pee in all day because they can't use public washrooms without the risk of physical assault. generally if someone is genderfluid, they will know you have no way of knowing they are identifying as that day, so they probably will not flip out at you. but you can always ask.",csb38zu,884.6789031467498,1,1434661591,64,7,5716,0,60.81588917525774,485.0,696.0,20.0,2,0.05,0.0,0.3,0.2,0.0,0.05,0.0,0.05,0.05,0.0,0.0,0.05,0.15,0.0,0.9000000000000002,0.11479113738360927,0.2268041237113402,0.0,0,0.0,489,44.34,43.50,49.06,52.63,24.45,16.16,86.91,58.49,14.11,4.70,0.41,0.61,1.43,0.00,2.25,9.20,7.36,12.27,11.66,4.70,7.98,3.68,16.77,4.91,2.66,1.43,1.23,3.07,2.66,2.04,0.61,0.20,0.20,0.20,8.79,0.00,0.00,0.61,0.41,19.63,2.04,3.68,1.23,5.73,1.64,8.38,1.23,0.41,0.61,0.20,5.32,2.25,2.25,1.43,0.00,3.07,1.02,0.82,0.82,0.20,0.41,0.82,13.09,1.43,11.25,1.23,6.54,3.27,0.61,0.00,0.00,0.20,0.00,0.00,0.82,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.82,0.00,13.91,3.89,4.91,0.20,0.00,0.20,0.00,0.20,0.00,1.23,1.64,1.64
t3_3ghqcq,"so, i think your argument can be split into two parts. **i. this method is not effective** i think the most convincing argument in favor of the blm protesters is that it worked. sanders was forced/convinced to release a more comprehensive platform on racial violence in this country due to the vast amount of flack he has been given by blm, both recently and at netroots. secondly, you say >it succeeds when the minds of the general populace are changed at a high rate toward the verbalized cause. through the witnessing of such actions and protests, suddenly the people turn their gaze toward those in power, who feel the stare of everyone looking at them, oppressing them with genuine and widespread mistrust of their stances. the people display a collective ""what are you going to do about it now?"" and the power of those at the top is actually threatened by the people who support them from below. but i think we are already at that point. most people recognize that there is a systemic problem in the way policing works that makes excessive force more likely to occur and to go without punishment, and most people also recognize that police violence is disproportionately focused on people of color, specifically black bodies. what we are lacking is concrete policy proposals by those in power to alleviate the distress of the population, and that is what the blm protesters accomplished. **ii. this method is targeting the wrong people** i think you are wrong to say sander's supporters are pro-blm. the huge backlash on reddit has shown, not only to this event but also to the shooting yesterday in ferguson, judging by top comments in large/default subs such as /r/news, has been overwhelmingly anti-black, and anti-blm. you may say this was because of the specific tactic, but more often then not the criticism was leveled at the movement itself with this incident being the trigger for the anger, not the cause. secondly, bernie sanders has come to represent the new ""champion of liberalism/ progressivism"" in america, and as such needs to be held to a high standard. his comments at netroots and his whole platform of worker solidarity are seen by many to push racial issues under the rug of income inequality or the fight against ""capitalism."" to many, this is not seen as an adequate response, and because of these tactics, bernie has clarified his views and updated his platform. the biggest obstacle for sanders to win a nomination is outreach to minorities, a demographic with which he currently polls very poorly with (i think in large part due to the attitude of his supporters). these incidents and his response have shown to help both sides, appeasing blm and helping hammer out a better platform on police violence. **iii. these are not mutually exclusive** finally, your view states that they did not take certain avenues of action into consideration, however, there is no reason you cannot do both as one does not sacrifice the other. you can raise awareness and confront leaders. blm has consistently done both and through these policies has made a real difference on the way politicians are talking about police violence.",ctydoee,527.6294490023693,1,1439243264,17,5,9349,0,53.39057584269665,534.0,826.0,24.0,1,0.125,0.0,0.16666666666666666,0.20833333333333334,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.041666666666666664,0.041666666666666664,0.7083333333333333,0.018710094253572517,0.29213483146067415,0.0,0,0.0,540,80.75,63.05,47.04,6.91,22.50,24.44,84.44,52.96,11.67,5.56,1.11,0.37,1.48,1.48,1.11,6.11,7.96,15.56,8.33,3.89,5.93,2.04,13.52,5.19,2.96,1.30,0.37,2.96,5.37,1.85,3.52,0.56,1.67,0.19,8.52,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.48,11.67,3.15,2.59,0.56,1.30,0.74,3.89,2.78,2.04,0.56,0.19,0.19,0.19,0.00,0.00,0.00,8.33,0.56,2.22,5.93,0.74,0.93,2.96,10.19,0.56,14.44,1.67,9.63,3.15,2.78,0.19,0.19,0.37,0.19,0.00,0.37,0.00,0.37,0.00,0.00,0.00,14.63,4.26,4.63,0.00,0.00,0.19,0.00,0.56,1.11,0.19,0.37,3.33

[...] given the 20% ratios, we have 40 men and 10 women, and 8 of the 40 men sometimes make sexist remarks towards women, while 2 of the 10 women make sexist remarks to men. i can't emphasise enough that there is no difference in sexism between the genders. > > let us see what happens when we have had 70 sexist remarks made. > > the luckiest man receives zero sexist remarks. but in fact he does not need to be very lucky, because most men receive no remarks. there is an unlucky guy [...] who receives three sexist remarks, [...] but that's the unluckiest guy out of 40. > > the luckiest woman receives four sexist remarks. so let us get this straight: the luckiest woman out of 10 experiences worse sexism than the unluckiest man out of 40. > > of course it gets worse. the unluckiest woman experiences nine incidents. on average? the mean number of sexist remarks per man is 0.35, while for women it is 5.6. there is a gender disparity of 4:1 but the disparity in experience is 16:1. > > men are no more sexist than women in this thought experiment, but women's experience is sixteen times worse than the men's. > > the maths that explains this is simple. with 20% women the gender ratio is 1:4. so there are 4 times as many men to make sexist remarks, so 4 times as many sexist remarks are made to women as to men. but there are 4 times fewer women to receive sexist remarks, so each individual woman is four times as likely to receive a given remark than an individual man is. these effects multiply, so in this example the mean number of sexist remarks per woman is 16 times the number per man. this holds in general, so with a gender ratio of 1:r, women will receive r2 times as many sexist remarks as men. > > that is the petrie multiplier. an argument that an attack on sexism in tech is not an attack on men. we can see that, in terms of suffering of sexist remarks, women in this situation suffer more. sure, the men in the thought experiment probably suffer in other aspects of their life, but it does not impact the fact that reducing sexist remarks overall will lead to a significant impact in the reduction of suffering in this situation. we can apply the same reasoning to any other minority group on the receiving end of hurtful remarks. being politically correct is not an attack on the people making the jokes or the off-hand remarks ? instead, it is a move to reduce the suffering of those affected by the remarks. and even when you entertain the idea that there is no relative degree of suffering, which i interpret as ""everyone suffers equally"" in some weird universal karmic balance system, it would mean that everyone suffers from some type of hurtful off-hand remark. in that case, reducing those remarks would reduce suffering for everyone.",csezvw7,742.1353820490725,1,1435000417,427,32,43946,0,61.48369694641829,635.0,973.0,41.0,1,0.0,0.0,0.21951219512195122,0.4146341463414634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.024390243902439025,0.04878048780487805,0.0,0.7073170731707318,0.10220467032967033,0.17165354330708663,0.0,0,0.0,669,86.93,82.30,18.16,4.52,17.61,19.43,81.61,46.64,9.27,2.54,0.30,1.35,0.15,0.15,0.60,6.73,7.77,14.50,7.17,3.44,5.38,1.79,13.60,5.83,3.89,0.75,5.68,2.84,4.78,1.35,3.44,0.30,0.60,1.79,13.90,0.00,0.30,2.99,3.44,13.30,1.79,3.29,0.45,2.54,1.94,4.04,5.53,0.30,3.74,0.75,1.05,0.30,0.60,0.00,0.15,4.63,1.94,0.60,1.49,0.75,0.45,1.20,10.31,0.30,10.01,1.79,5.38,3.74,0.75,0.30,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.30,0.00,0.15,0.15,0.00,0.00,18.24,6.58,4.19,0.90,0.00,0.15,0.00,0.30,0.30,0.75,0.15,4.93

t3_3b4blv,"as someone who has been pregnant, given birth, and is still pro-choice, i will give you my view of the matter. i am pro-choice, i support women who do have abortions for whatever reason they have to get one. it is not my business, but, at the same time this does not mean that i think all women should get abortions just because they can. i found myself unexpectedly pregnant, i was 29 and in a 10 year relationship at the time, i was financially stable, and the thought of abortion still went through my mind. why? because being pregnant is not just about a baby, its about the mothers health too. being pregnant is absolutely terrifying if the baby is planned or unplanned. it hurts, it changes your entire body, and depending on how you got pregnant (rape or consentual sex) emotionally and mentally it is challenging. it is like your body is taken over by an alien. obviously i had my son, then i got my tubes tide, i still support abortion though. if we lived in a perfect world everyone would have access to contraceptives, like the pill, condoms, tubal litigaitons, etc. but sadly we don't, women are shamed into thinking that sex for them is slutty, that we are somehow bad for thinking its ok to have sex for pleasure, that we are only allowed to be baby makers. so, we do not buy the contraceptives, because in a lot of areas women are told that bc is wrong and something only whores use. or they are told lies about them by people who do not want them to do something. naturally one of them ends up pregnant due to lack of information regarding safe sex, and preventing pregnancy. now they are looked down on for not only having sex, but getting pregnant ""why didn't she use any bc or condoms?"" etc. so she goes for an abortion and is met there with protesters saying shes a whore, that the baby should not suffer. so then she has the baby, with no means of taking care of it, and the government says ""well we dont' want to help you, you should have closed your legs."" it is seriously a system that shames women for wanting the same sexual pleasure that men are applauded for. we are denied the knowledge to prevent pregnancy, restricted on contraceptives, denied abortions, then denied help to raise a baby from a society that has done everything in it is power to tell us that we do not have control of our own body. i am telling you this because it is a harsh reality that a lot of women have to face on a day to day. pregnancy is not just about the potential fetus, it is about the mother too. abortions exist as a last resort for a woman who was either uninformed about how to effectively prevent a pregnancy, had their contraception fail despite how well it was used, cannot physically carry a child because it will kill them, or unfortunately they were raped. people should not be pro-life to save the baby, people should be pro-choice so that when a baby is brought into the world, it is by someone who can care for it and give it a good life. it is also about body autonomy, i do not have to allow anyone to use my body with out my consent, that includes a potential human.",csiqffl,218.2539243189534,1,1435272723,77,31,1779,0,63.05469504066126,577.0,827.0,26.0,7,0.038461538461538464,0.038461538461538464,0.23076923076923078,0.07692307692307693,0.0,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.15384615384615385,0.0,0.576923076923077,0.06325396825396826,0.21663778162911612,0.0,0,0.0,583,30.12,77.48,14.88,14.03,22.42,15.95,93.31,61.06,16.98,9.09,3.43,1.72,1.37,0.69,1.89,7.89,6.35,12.35,13.21,6.35,7.20,2.74,20.93,1.72,1.20,2.06,0.69,1.03,5.66,2.40,3.26,0.51,0.69,0.69,15.61,3.77,0.00,2.06,0.34,15.44,2.40,4.12,2.06,3.26,1.20,4.46,1.03,0.34,0.34,0.34,7.55,1.20,4.46,5.32,0.17,8.58,2.40,0.86,2.92,1.72,1.37,4.46,14.07,1.20,7.20,0.86,3.43,2.92,0.86,0.00,0.00,0.51,0.00,0.17,1.54,0.51,0.34,0.34,0.34,0.00,13.55,4.12,6.86,0.00,0.00,0.34,0.00,0.69,0.69,0.51,0.34,0.00

t3_37m855,"so you are seeing racism as a much more simple, face level problem. blatant ""racists"" are the problem in this idea, and you are right when they often will not engage in any practice or trend of other cultures or races that they are prejudiced towards. however, racism is not that simple. the people that are really the danger today as far as racist attitudes go, are the ""white people with black friends"" that you speak of. the one's that ""don't have a problem"". i can't give any specific examples, but you can often find more subtle hints of racist feelings in these people. my own parents can say they love all races as much as they want, but i still find them holding prejudices and bad feelings about any number of problems that black people face worldwide. in short, having ""a black friend"", or having ""no problem"" with black people, does not absolve you from racist beliefs or acts. racism is heavily ingrained in societies worldwide, especially the united states. so, for culturally appropriating black culture, let us look at some examples. hip-hop and rap are at the forefront of popular music since the 80s, and these fields have been dominated by black (and usually male) artists. but ""rappers"" such as iggy azalea (who has adopted more than just the music, but the inflection and voice of black rappers as well), mac miller, macklemore, eminem, are often right up there as some of the most popular musicians in that field. but when the problems of rap music in america is discussed, and hatred thrown towards it, these musicians are conveniently left out of the discussion. sure, mac miller basically raps about getting high, not a real problem, macklemore does some activism (on what seems to be a publicity stunt every time). but eminem is one of the most hateful rappers out there, he has songs about beating his girlfriends, about hating gay people. i would say he has up there in the most violent rappers around, but he has not really talked about. instead popular black male rappers are shunned for talking about ""money, cars, women and guns"". to give some more to think about on this topic, look up the stereotypes of black people around the end of slavery in the u.s., you can find that, once black people were given their freedom, the popular stereotype was changed from ""dopey, know-nothing who is fine with his imprisonment"", to ""violent, hateful, masculine beast who needs to be put down"". it is worth thinking about that second stereotype in the context of rap music today, and see that black people didn't create this trope of music out of thin air, it was created long ago by people outside of the race. from dreadlocks/locs/afros/cornrows, to ""twerking"", to aave (african-american vernacular english), a lot of popular trends in america have been taken from the black communities that live here. the reason it is being taken from them, is because on a large scale/historical/social viewpoint, non-black americans will adopt these styles, and turn around in the same movement and shun these people for their behavior. i know that's exactly what you are questioning, how it is seen that way. but you bring up examples of certain people you know, and as i have said you do not know for a fact that these people are devoid of racist behavior. the first question i would ask these people when seeing them with locs in their hair, or listening to rap music, is ""what do you think about the way this country's police force treats black people?"", obviously a hypothetical situation to ask that. but it is worth paying attention to how these people partake in cultural practices of these people, but will ignore the plights of these same people. that's where the majority of their racist behavior comes out, in their voluntary ignorance of the people they say they ""love"". cultures can intermingle, and anyone with knowledge on cultural appropriation should understand that. people who oppose appropriation do not oppose adoption. appropriation occurs when the appropriators deny the fact of what they have done, and continue to shun the people they have taken from (which can occur in any number of ways). hope this helps? racism is a giant beast that is really important to understand today, so i am happy to explain more if you are willing to learn more (not to assume my knowledge is the authority, i am a white male after all).",crnwj3v,795.1334496437688,1,1432840732,171,8,3150,0,60.41058823529414,752.0,1102.0,34.0,3,0.029411764705882353,0.0,0.38235294117647056,0.29411764705882354,0.0,0.029411764705882353,0.029411764705882353,0.058823529411764705,0.029411764705882353,0.0,0.0,0.058823529411764705,0.0,0.058823529411764705,0.9705882352941176,0.06356151275937373,0.2300531914893617,0.0,0,0.0,761,66.71,78.48,30.09,23.71,24.55,18.13,85.41,51.64,12.35,5.78,1.31,0.13,1.58,0.66,2.10,6.57,5.78,15.11,9.33,5.39,6.57,1.71,16.29,6.04,2.89,2.10,0.53,3.15,5.26,2.50,2.63,0.13,1.18,0.00,13.53,0.13,0.39,0.13,1.18,14.59,3.42,1.18,1.84,3.81,1.71,4.34,5.78,2.89,2.63,0.26,0.92,0.39,0.13,0.13,0.00,6.18,1.31,0.92,2.23,0.66,1.31,2.50,12.75,0.53,11.30,1.58,6.96,2.76,0.66,1.84,0.00,0.53,0.13,0.00,0.26,0.00,0.13,0.00,0.13,0.00,18.53,4.20,7.23,0.00,0.00,0.26,0.00,0.53,3.15,0.92,1.58,0.66

t3_3ibb3g,"i am a bit late to the conversation, but hope that you will still see this. i am biased on this issue in the sense that i side with the ""danger-is-real"" side, but i think that the claim of 'neither side is actually listening to the other, and that makes it currently worthless' is not true on two points. first, that there is one side listening to the other, and second, that it is not actually worthless. even in the op, it is not mentioned how the 'danger-is-real' side is not listening to the other. you point out how they may be logically inconsistent, or have contradictory views within their own larger conception of ai risk, but never actually write down how they ignore the other side. following this, i am going to assume that you meant that 'danger-is-real' side is not listening to the other side because the other side has pointed out such flaws. if this is not what you intended at all, please correct me. in this case, i would say that the 'danger-is-real' side has actually succeeded in addressing these points. the most common accusation leveled at ai researchers is that of the immensely low likelihood of such an event occurring, which is [acknowledged](by the 'danger-is-real' side. you mention how this soft-selling, but it is really just presenting it as the way it is. it would be inaccurate in their eyes to say that the doomsday is nigh, and 'danger-is-real' people really do emphasize just how rare such an event is. what makes this cause justifiable in their eyes is the massive risk/reward involved in the development of such strong ai. your point about 'danger-is-real' people pointing out more possibilities thus making it more likely is recognized by many from that side as well, with 'privileging the hypothesis' (or similar terms) commonly used. in any case, the point is that the probability is so ridiculously low, and the opportunity-cost/existential risk so ridiculously high that almost any calculation that you can do will be off by many orders of magnitude. the 'danger-is-real' people recognize this, but just happen to believe the numbers are so skewed on the side of potentially near-infinite benefit that even being off by 10^5 still makes things worth it. (this brings up the idea of pascal's mugging, for which i have not seen a really satisfactory answer to. that does not mean people have not been trying to address it, though.) there is one primary reason why it may appear that this kind of understanding is not going on: this immensely complex issue being grouped into two large sides as opposed to thousands of individual viewpoints is an inaccurate view. obviously, people lie all across this spectrum and hold different views, and because each person has a different method of responding and a different amount of knowledge regarding the issue, some will constructively respond while others don't. it is obviously convenient to lump them together, but there are people from each side listening to each other. from here, it is easy for us to just point at examples contradicting each other, so i will move on to the next part of this ? whether this entire affair is constructive or worthless. my belief is that even if most of the discussion regarding these issues is misinformed (which i increasingly do not find to be the case), there is still at least some legitimate [discussion](going on. this discussion is usually conducted by people with extensive knowledge in the field, and who have meaningful contributions to add. it is not just the same points being recycled over and over. a few years ago, the conversation was very much still about definitions and what exactly people were talking about when they said strong ai or fai or anything along those lines. nowadays, it still happens since not everybody follows this closely, but people are actually talking about the cost-benefit analysis and going deeper than that. there has been progress, and it is had value. additionally, even if you still believe that the sides are not listening to each other, i would argue that there is still value to this discussion (ie it is not worthless). it comes down to publicity/media-attention, and by having these bigger names enter the conversation, even if they are not fully addressing, responding to or even listening to the other side, they are still encouraging more people to become informed on the topic. at this point, any attention that can be given to ai is largely positive, given that it is a burgeoning field that will continue to grow quickly in the coming years. people should know more about these developments, and the ai debate helps to inform. in summary, i feel that the arguments are off in the sense that (1) at least have one side listening to the other, and responding, and (2) generate 'worth', whether through legitimately bringing the field of ai forwards, or through enhancing public knowledge on the issue.",cug7ogk,991.4124544383317,1,1440599116,24,9,100387,1,49.176222826086956,828.0,1286.0,32.0,1,0.0,0.03125,0.5,0.4375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03125,0.03125,0.03125,0.0,0.0625,0.0625,1.1875,0.06659872385678836,0.21014492753623187,0.0,0,0.0,864,47.39,44.95,74.76,15.92,27.00,18.40,88.89,57.64,14.12,3.59,1.50,0.12,0.93,0.00,1.04,10.53,6.48,12.85,10.88,7.41,6.13,2.20,17.13,4.75,2.43,1.85,1.50,3.47,5.09,2.20,2.89,0.35,1.50,0.81,8.56,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,17.25,3.70,2.31,1.04,3.94,1.27,7.18,2.78,0.93,1.27,0.35,0.35,0.23,0.12,0.00,0.00,5.21,0.93,0.81,2.43,0.81,0.58,1.50,12.15,1.62,13.66,1.85,9.03,3.01,0.69,0.00,0.12,0.58,0.23,0.00,0.23,0.00,0.12,0.00,0.12,0.00,17.01,3.70,5.44,0.12,0.00,0.00,0.00,2.43,0.23,2.55,1.62,0.93

t3_3dgf6j,"hi. congratulations on getting into, and being able to go to college. i hope it is a fabulous experience for you. >but i have a fear myself of being falsely accused, or accused in a case where consent is retroactively removed. i do not think of this potential as being very high; i do not think most women are that vindictive; however in the event that it occurs it seems the results can be devastating. it would be a very scary situation. as would hundreds of other situations that might occur. the constant in all those situations would be you. remember, fears are internal things. therefore, should be dealt with internally. that is, instead of worrying about what a partner might potentially do, make sure you are confident in what you do. nothing wrong with telling a partner(s) that you have this concern too. discuss it with them. your feelings are valid, your concern exists. how your partner(s) react to this disclosure might help you decide if they are a good choice. might sooth your fears. there is a lot of power in communication. > i do not think i am of the party that has difficulty understanding consent knowing it is an issue of consent is no small thing. get familiar with the language, and comfortable using it when applicable. use more communication instead of less. do not assume your partners know much about consent, actually have the talks. whether you want a plethora of sexual partners or a single monogamous honey, you can learn by and teach each other better communication (not just about consent) which will directly reduce the possibility of any ... misunderstandings, or hook ups with unstable people. also, i want to point out that you are not immune to sexual assault because you are a young man. read the stats below with the understanding that some of those (90% +) unreported assault victims are men. as you make friends, and lovers, have each others backs. learn how to keep each other safe and do so. do not settle for hook-ups with people you do not trust, or friends who do not respect you or others. make friends with both genders and have everyone's back. do not fall into that us vs. them fear baiting malarkey. you are stepping off into your future. make it, and the relationships in it as positive and unlikely to have issues as possible. **some stats: ** according to the [national sexual violence resource center](>**campus sexual assault** * one in 5 women and one in 16 men are sexually assaulted while in college (i). * more than 90% of sexual assault victims on college campuses do not report the assault (c) * 63.3% of men at one university who self-reported acts qualifying as rape or attempted rape admitted to committing repeat rapes (j) >**crime reports** * rape is the most under-reported crime; 63% of sexual assaults are not reported to police (o). only 12% of child sexual abuse is reported to the authorities (g). * the prevalence of false reporting is between 2% and 10%. for example, a study of eight u.s. communities, which included 2,059 cases of sexual assault, found a 7.1% rate of false reports (k). a study of 136 sexual assault cases in boston found a 5.9% rate of false reports (j). researchers studied 812 reports of sexual assault from 2000-03 and found a 2.1% rate of false reports (h). **tl dr:** better communication lessens troubling situations and builds confidence and experience in handling situations. *spelling",ct5oi70,347.4727742503643,1,1437077144,30,12,61977,0,67.15500000000002,564.0,850.0,47.0,1,0.02127659574468085,0.02127659574468085,0.0851063829787234,0.19148936170212766,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02127659574468085,0.0,0.02127659574468085,0.02127659574468085,0.0,0.38297872340425526,0.06580557124035384,0.24468085106382978,0.0,0,0.0,588,65.38,69.51,21.80,3.97,14.34,22.45,84.35,50.17,11.90,5.61,1.53,0.17,3.40,0.00,0.51,6.29,5.44,13.44,9.86,3.57,6.12,2.38,14.97,4.42,2.38,1.87,4.08,2.72,7.31,2.55,4.76,1.02,2.55,0.17,10.71,0.00,1.70,0.34,0.68,16.16,3.57,2.04,1.36,4.25,1.53,5.27,0.68,0.00,0.00,0.17,3.06,0.00,0.34,2.72,0.00,10.20,3.23,1.36,4.42,1.36,1.19,1.19,11.39,1.53,7.31,0.68,5.44,1.36,4.59,0.17,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.34,0.00,0.34,0.17,0.00,0.00,23.64,7.65,3.40,0.34,0.51,0.00,0.00,0.68,0.00,0.17,4.25,6.63

t3_3clrl2,"the opposition to interracial marriage was based on the belief that certain races were genetically inferior (whatever that means). yes, people cited their religion for reasons, but ultimately that's what it would come back to (for the most part). since 'genetic inferiority' is a scientific claim, it requires scientific evidence to support it. there is none, in fact there is plenty to disprove it. so interracial marriage happened without problem. (i like what other commenters have said about interracial marriage not changing the definition of marriage). opposition to same-sex marriage is based on opposition to specific *actions*, and not wanting the government to sanction and support those actions. people who are opposed to same-sex marriage would also be opposed to two heterosexuals of the same sex getting married. the marrying couple's sexual *orientation* is not the target of disapproval, it is the *actions* of two individuals. (yes, i am aware that many people who oppose same-sex marriage also actively hate or are at least grossed out by gay people--but that is irrelevant to a discussion of the possible social repercussions of legalizing same-sex marriage.) the fact that certain people are biologically predisposed to want to do those actions, and others are completely *not* interested in doing them, is a confusing side note to this argument. this is a distinction that will probably be hard to make sense of, especially since i had trouble trying to explain it. let me know if you have points you would like clarified. i'd like to echo what others have said, and what has been said for the past several years: the government's interest in marriage is in harboring a place to raise successful citizens. every solid study i have read up on shows that a child's best chance is to be raised by its biological parents*. whenever possible, the government supports this with tax breaks and by attaching things like inheritance and hospital visitation rights to marriage. since the child of same-sex partners cannot be raised by both biological parents, they are automatically at a disadvantage. at least, that's the argument. *i know there are studies out there that suggest that same-sex parents are just as likely to raise successful children as the biological parents. every one of these studies that i have looked at has been deeply flawed--usually with non-random samples (parents who volunteer for a study about successful parenting are probably going to be the ones who are doing pretty well), extremely small sample sizes, or by comparing a population of same-sex parents that got their children through the difficult and expensive process of adoption to a population of heterosexual parents of all types--adopters, planned parents, accidental parents, etc. from what i understand, the meta-study the supreme court cited in their decision was a study of these flawed studies. feel free to link a good study on same-sex parents.",csx7zrc,348.7793531106345,1,1436434976,45,9,38008,0,42.763803602058346,477.0,801.0,22.0,2,0.09090909090909091,0.0,0.09090909090909091,0.4090909090909091,0.0,0.045454545454545456,0.0,0.045454545454545456,0.09090909090909091,0.0,0.0,0.045454545454545456,0.0,0.0,0.8181818181818181,0.07222222222222222,0.2662473794549266,0.0,0,0.0,490,79.47,70.23,13.15,56.61,22.27,27.96,90.00,50.82,11.63,3.27,1.84,0.00,0.41,0.00,1.02,8.37,6.73,15.51,10.41,4.08,3.67,1.43,15.71,5.51,3.67,2.24,0.61,2.86,6.12,3.88,2.24,0.20,0.61,0.41,11.22,4.49,0.20,0.00,0.00,13.47,3.06,1.63,1.43,3.06,2.45,3.06,1.63,0.41,0.61,0.41,3.67,0.00,0.20,2.65,0.00,11.02,4.90,1.22,3.88,1.43,0.82,2.86,10.41,0.41,7.76,1.43,4.90,1.63,4.90,0.00,0.00,0.82,0.41,0.00,0.61,0.00,0.00,0.41,0.20,0.00,17.76,4.49,4.08,0.20,0.00,0.00,0.00,3.27,0.00,1.63,2.04,2.04

t3_35mgfp,"i think you are somewhat ignoring a key part of descriptivism, which is to describe language *as it is actually used*. descriptivism does not say that all mistakes are just non-standard varieties. what it is really does is identify dialectical differences and find the underlying structures of grammatical language. so, descriptivism is *describing* the universal rules of a language, whereas prescriptivism is *prescribing* an ideal standard for a language. in regards to your example sentences, in english, a sentence needs to have an svo structure in order to be grammatical. this is not only a prescriptive view, but also descriptive, because it is an observable phenomenon that is universal across the english language. so when you use the sentences: *""he went to the shop""* and *""he gone to the shop""*, both are following an svo pattern, and are thus grammatical in terms of descriptivism. however, when you consider the sentence ""shops went the he to"", this would be considered ungrammatical by descriptivists, because it uses an ovs structure, which is not grammatical in english. so i think the main thing that might be confusing you is the thought that descriptivism sees mistakes as variances. while this is *sometimes* the case, descriptivists do still acknowledge that language has rules that need to be followed in order to be understood. so, descriptive and prescriptive rules do sometimes agree with each other, especially when it comes to base grammar rules such as word order (like above) and pluralization (i.e. ""i have three apple"" is ungrammatical both in the descriptive and prescriptive viewpoints). but when it comes to finer points of language, they tend to disagree. take for example, the word ""funner"". prescriptivists will tell you that it is not a word, whereas descriptivists will tell you that it is, because the affixation of -er to the end of a description word means it is *""more so""* than something else. tl;dr: descriptivism *describes* language as it is used, prescriptivism *prescribes* language as it ""should"" be used.",cr5tt2i,769.414991016159,1,1431402770,36,10,4638,0,48.90059886605246,332.0,542.0,17.0,2,0.058823529411764705,0.058823529411764705,0.23529411764705882,0.29411764705882354,0.0,0.058823529411764705,0.0,0.11764705882352941,0.0,0.058823529411764705,0.0,0.058823529411764705,0.058823529411764705,0.0,1.0,0.05945391414141414,0.19879518072289157,0.0,0,0.0,334,50.40,59.46,13.46,21.19,22.27,27.84,80.84,55.69,12.57,4.19,0.90,0.00,2.10,0.90,0.30,8.38,8.08,11.98,11.68,5.99,8.98,1.20,21.26,2.99,3.29,2.10,0.30,2.10,2.69,1.20,1.50,0.30,0.00,0.00,6.89,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.90,14.67,2.99,2.69,2.10,1.80,0.60,4.49,0.90,0.60,0.30,0.00,2.69,0.00,2.69,0.00,0.00,3.29,0.00,0.30,2.69,0.30,0.00,2.40,15.87,0.90,8.98,2.10,3.29,2.69,0.00,1.20,0.00,0.90,0.00,0.00,0.60,0.00,0.00,0.30,0.30,0.00,23.65,5.09,6.29,0.60,0.30,0.00,0.00,0.60,4.19,0.00,1.20,5.39

t3_32l478,"psychology grad student here.. part of the difficulty in trying to change your view is that your use of terms is very imprecise. hopefully the following helps you see how to more properly: distinguish between emotions and feelings; answer why we believe animals have emotions; and understand why we can't really talk about animal feelings. we understand the basic genetic components of emotions pretty well. we understand what neural structures are involved, and how they are involved very well. we can make behavioral predictions based on emotional states and we see those predictions upheld in experiments ranging across a huge number of animal species. there is every reason to accept that animals have emotions. there is actually no good reason to doubt this claim at all. for this to be false it would mean that entire fairly primitive neural systems would have to have entirely different functions in animals than they do in humans. moreover, it would be the case that these functions would only be different with respect to emotions, not other cognitive functions where we often have even stronger evidence that they function identically to in humans. for example, between rats and humans, the amygdala would have to function differently with respect to emotions while at the same time, it would still have to function identically with respect to motivational circuits. this would revolutionize all of neuroscience as we know it! next, when talking about emotions, they are generally mapped on two scales (sometimes more, but the 2-scale graph is very common), of valiance and intensity. valiance is how positive or negative the emotion is, while intensity is how strongly the emotion is felt. we have no reason to believe human ranges on these scales are significantly different from other animals with similar neural structures -- which includes most mammals. the limbic system is part of our neural system that is shared across species. what's even more amazing is that we now have very good reason to believe that some mammals have not only emotions but empathy. the work being done on mirror neurons is showing that charles darwin was probably more right than not in arguing that both emotions and empathy are genetic and preserved across species by evolution. what we do have reason to question is to what degree how we experience emotions subjectively differs. this is what we typically refer to as feelings. how you feel is subjective. what emotion underpins that feeling is a question of neurological function. because we have language centers and highly evolved cortical structures for executive function, it is likely that when our brain has an emotion we can mediate our subjective experience of that emotion (feelings) in ways that animals can not. this means that there is actually an argument to be made that animals may have a more visceral, stronger experience of feelings than human beings do. but we do not know that for certain. it may be that they experience feelings very, very differently. we can't know. the subjective experience is not something anyone has figured out how to measure in animals yet.",cqc7n5n,311.9225597433765,1,1429038432,24,7,1710,0,47.221007281553426,515.0,858.0,28.0,19,0.03571428571428571,0.0,0.17857142857142858,0.42857142857142855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03571428571428571,0.03571428571428571,0.07142857142857142,0.03571428571428571,0.14285714285714285,0.0,0.9642857142857142,0.12978168950391172,0.21553398058252426,0.0,0,0.0,516,35.30,73.24,28.74,72.89,18.43,28.88,83.91,55.23,13.95,5.62,0.00,3.88,0.78,0.00,0.97,8.33,3.29,12.79,12.60,7.95,5.23,2.13,17.44,4.84,3.49,3.68,0.39,2.91,7.36,3.49,0.97,0.19,0.39,0.00,8.91,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,20.54,6.40,4.07,1.55,3.88,1.36,5.23,3.49,0.78,0.00,1.74,1.36,1.16,0.19,0.00,0.00,8.14,4.65,0.58,1.94,0.58,0.39,1.16,14.92,0.97,7.56,0.58,4.65,2.13,1.16,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.39,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.39,0.00,10.85,5.43,2.71,0.19,0.39,0.00,0.19,0.58,0.00,0.58,0.78,0.00

t3_328mdv,"i agree with everything people have said so far, so i do not want to repeat what they have already said. perhaps the main differences old and modern games implement hard mode will make your feel less guilty about skipping hard mode: 1. the way old games implement hard mode is by taking away the number of default lives or continues or otherwise reducing the amount of survivability the player has so that the margin of error is smaller than playing on easy mode. modern games implement hard mode by increasing the survivability of enemies, mostly implemented and decried by gamers as hp bloat, something that modern rpgs are particularly guilty of. in gaming terms, old school hard mode turns your character into a glass cannon while modern hard mode turns your enemies into tanks. the relative difference might be the same, but old school hard mode allows players who have mastered the game to breeze through the game as easily as a noob who's playing it on easy mode. this is not true for modern implementations of hard mode. 2. old school hard mode also implement hard mode by changing encounters or fundamentally changing the game mechanics that's a lot more than lame boring ones like player gets -10% in elemental resistance or items cost 10% more gold. stuff like adding more enemies, placing the enemies in a more advantageous position, introducing harder enemies early in the game, introducing more mechanics. the result is that the game is a fundamentally different experience besides being harder. 3. old school games also had a policy of denying players from seeing the ""real"" ending if you didn't play on hard mode, with the nicer ones only denying you the ""real"" ending if you played on easy mode. take doom for example, which implemented its hard mode particularly well. the change from the easiest difficulty to the second hardest difficulty includes a greater amount of enemies, enemies doing more damage, less ammo lying around, etc. the actual survivability of the enemies is still the say ie there is no hp bloat. the jump from ultraviolence to nightmare mode is huge because not only are the enemies still doing yet more damage, they also come back alive so you can never truly kill them, fireballs move twice as fast, demons/specters run stupidly fast. all these changes fundamentally change how the game is played; the game being harder is just an intentional side effect. it is not simply, ""well, nightmare mode is a lot harder than ultraviolence."" now why has the implementation of hard mode change? i believe the main reason is that developers want easy mode/hard mode to be something that you can toggle in the options menu while playing the game and not something that you have to commit to, which is how old school hard mode was implemented. i am playing fire emblem: path of radiance (the gamecube one) right now, and the way hard mode is implemented is old school, right down to being unable to change back to easy/normal mode if i find a level too hard or something. really, modern hard mode is mostly a time sink, which i it would not got time for. so, about your cmv. i wouldn't feel guilty about it because modern hard mode is different from old school hard mode, and rather than making the game harder in an interesting way, it makes the game harder in a boring, bland, time-consuming way. most people that would give you shit for playing in easy mode care about ""old school cred"" and modern hard mode does not give any/enough old school cred, so fuck it.",cq90btb,511.2805829268726,1,1428779735,55,24,8844,0,57.64516052129689,605.0,898.0,26.0,5,0.15384615384615385,0.038461538461538464,0.19230769230769232,0.07692307692307693,0.0,0.07692307692307693,0.038461538461538464,0.07692307692307693,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.0,0.0,0.07692307692307693,0.0,0.7692307692307694,0.1231042291042291,0.21487603305785125,0.0,0,0.0,615,75.02,58.36,36.06,25.77,23.65,16.10,83.90,45.53,8.13,3.41,1.14,0.00,1.79,0.00,0.49,4.72,8.13,11.06,7.80,6.83,5.69,1.79,13.98,12.85,5.85,1.46,1.30,2.76,8.78,4.39,4.39,0.49,2.28,0.33,8.13,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,13.33,0.98,3.25,1.63,3.41,1.79,4.55,5.85,0.16,0.49,5.04,0.65,0.16,0.33,0.16,0.00,6.34,2.60,0.98,1.63,0.98,0.49,1.63,10.08,0.33,13.82,2.60,5.20,6.50,1.79,4.07,0.00,0.16,0.33,0.33,0.81,0.33,0.00,0.16,0.33,0.00,13.01,4.07,4.72,0.33,0.16,0.16,0.00,0.33,1.30,0.65,0.33,0.98

t3_2vks7u,"everyone here seems to be talking about the money aspect of things, but i think the educational aspect is a more convincing argument. education does not mean academic learning. it just means you are learning something. college is not inherently about learning academically, it is mostly about learning a useful skill or set of knowledge that you can build a career on. many universities have majors for music, acting, arts, and all sorts of non academic things. so when you consider that many popular sports are million and billion dollar industries, it actually makes sense to have sports as a program in college. a successful football player in high school is not likely to rake in millions of dollars of ad revenue straight out of graduation. 90% of the time he will have to hone his skills and attract attention in a college football program. when athletes enter college on a scholarship, they are going there to learn a trade, one which is actually much more competitive and requires more exceptional natural talent and training than the vast majority of fields offered at the university level. if you think that athletes are the exception to the rule in terms of admissions putting less emphasis on academic merit, you should interview some people to went to school on a music scholarship. it is incredibly different than getting a degree in biology. if you still question the logic behind it, just try to imagine what the consequences of removing that system would be. all the athletes who failed to meet the academic rigor of students who are actually trying to enter a highly technical field would never be discovered. sports would have less exceptional players. if a completely non academic alternative to college arose for sports training, you would be discouraging intelligent athletes from learning. maybe you personally do not care about those types of consequences, but perhaps you can at least see how many people have a very strong interest in allowing athletes into college based more on their potential to become successful than on their traditional academic merits.",coitx3o,404.80883465683365,1,1423708440,218,24,19969,0,44.634867615273805,347.0,575.0,16.0,2,0.0,0.0,0.1875,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.1875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.625,0.04169934640522876,0.2881844380403458,0.0,0,0.0,348,80.75,61.32,33.18,74.00,21.75,27.01,90.52,50.29,9.48,4.31,0.29,0.00,2.59,0.57,0.86,5.17,6.90,15.52,8.91,6.32,4.60,1.44,15.80,8.05,3.45,2.01,1.44,4.31,4.31,3.45,0.86,0.00,0.29,0.57,7.47,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.57,18.97,6.03,1.72,2.30,4.60,1.44,5.46,1.15,0.29,0.57,0.00,0.29,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,5.75,0.57,2.59,2.30,0.86,0.86,0.29,11.78,0.86,9.48,1.72,6.32,1.44,12.36,4.02,0.00,2.01,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,8.33,4.60,3.45,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.29

t3_3iynfo,"this is kind of an aside:? i think both sides of this argument are missing the point here (and i do agree with points on both sides). while i do think that it is possible for automation to replace the lion's share of modern jobs (i just watched a lecture yesterday where it was claimed that only ~20% of factory jobs were lost overseas whereas they discovered in retrospect that almost ~80% were lost due to automation), i also think economists opposing this view have a good point when they say that we can create new jobs, ones that we can't even imagine today, to keep the majority of people employed to the same degree as today. that said, i think there are two *very important* factors missing from this discussion:? 1) the inherent value of a newly created jobs compared to past jobs, and 2) our economic system's ability to accommodate accelerating technological change in terms of employment regarding the first point, people tend to become disillusioned about work on a psychological level when they feel that their work is not adding any value. that was one of marx's core critiques about capitalism when he argued how essential it was for the workers to control the means of production. the less valuable/necessary people percieve their jobs, regardless of how well compensated they are for it, the less satisfied they will be with their lives. i recently read an article about how the vast majority of people in cities like london, a place where many people (office drones) are employed in information industries doing jobs that didn't exist ten to fifteen years ago, feel that their jobs are utterly meaningless in the grand scheme of things (and they are not wrong) and many subsequently feel depressed. london is an extreme example but rest assured, with increasing automation, most other places will start to catch up. information and information-based services will be (already is) the most important product that we produce, not physical goods/labour. this means is that the work we do as humans is becoming more work for the sake of work. a century ago, the majority of work that we did were things that quite obviously needed to be done. we repaired things, we built things, we provided crucial services, and so on. think about ten people around you today and ask yourself: do the jobs they do create a net benefit for their lives and the lives of people around them, or are their jobs essentially bullshit? you'd be surprised at how many jobs today add little to no value. even if they do add some value, it is often not (nearly) enough to rationalize it taking up 40+ hours of someone's life each week. this trend is only going to get worse, too, as more and more ""critical"" jobs are automated/rendered obsolete and more and more bullshit jobs get added to the pool. it is no wonder that people are miserable: we have seen a kind of spiritual decay where the vast majority of people have become miserable in their employment and that it is only going to get worse until we decide enough is enough and no longer require people to work in order to provide for themselves. this is all exacerbated by the fact that we are collectively more educated and aware than we have ever been, and that we all know the most surefire way to become wealthy is to game the system (like on wall street), not create value for others. as per the second point, say you disagree with my first point and want to argue that the value of new jobs being added to the economy is worthwhile enough to continue to employ the majority of people in new jobs. fair enough. the other problem with this is that a lot of the jobs being added do not fit into the employment model of the past century. it is becoming harder and harder for companies to justify hiring people full time, putting them all in an office and making them sit in cubicles for 40+ hours per week. just look at the business models of uber, amazon, facebook, instagram and so on: these companies are indicative of a 21st century employment model. they are not traditional vertically integrated companies that need to hire tens of thousands of people in order to function, instead they get by on hiring a handful of people and providing a service to more than a billion people. traditional vertically integrated companies are learning from this as well and reducing the number of employees they have (when they can get away with it).? thanks to the internet and accelerating technological change, these 21st century business models are scalable in a way that traditional business models weren't. a lot of the information-based services and distribution models around them that needed to exist last century are totally irrelevant now and are in the middle of a mass extinction. that's why we have been hearing the death rattle from the mpaa and many other large ""information brokers"": they are irrelevant and they are flailing wildly trying to find a way to prop up the old business model just so they can survive (while making everyone hate them in the process). we do not need a middle man anymore, the software is the middle man with algorithms replacing humans as gatekeepers to 1s and 0s.? so regardless of what you think about automation and job creation, you can't dodge the fact that our current employment models no longer make sense. the world is full of offices that exist for the sake of tradition (and supposed information security) where the majority of people sit at their desks doing valueless busy work and surfing the internet every chance they get. that's why we are seeing a huge boom in freelancing. a (regulated) uber-style employment is likely going to be the new employment model for the next few decades. companies are going to want to hire freelancers (from anywhere in the world), have them sign ndas, produce x amount of work for them and those freelancers might do work for 2-3 companies at the same time. blue collar work is no exception. companies like mcdonalds are slowly and carefully revealing to the world that they intend to phase out many of their workers in the coming years, something i expect will be accelerated by minimum wage increases. retailers, large and small, are beginning to becoming nothing more than glorified show rooms and many are losing the battle against online shopping. jobs in the transportation industry (taxis, trucking etc) see the writing on the wall. ""sharing economy"" services like airbnb and uber will continue to have an impact. services like instagram and smartphone cameras killed vertically integrated behemoths like kodak. the list goes on. anyway, even if you think that automation is going to displace rather than replace people, i think you still need to concede that replacement is possible if we allow it, and that there are good arguments for replacement over creating jobs for the sake of creating jobs. first and foremost, unless we do something radical (like basic income) a lot of people (especially those not educated or business/tech savvy) are going to fall in the cracks opened up by accelerating change (like anyone who works in the transportation industry today). i also think there is another, even better argument for allowing ourselves to drop out of the labour market if we want to, and that argument is an environmental one: we overproduce and overconsume more than any other point in history, it is unsustainable and that we need to start producing and consuming less and therefore we need to start thinking up a new way to organize economic activity around the concept of sustainability. **late edit**: added tl;dr **tl;dr** - basic human needs are finite and can be totally satisfied with automation in the foreseeable future - current levels of automation have already displaced humans away from work that has obvious value - new jobs have increasingly less value than before when they are created in spaces where they can't be automated (yet) and thus job satisfaction is on the decline - many new jobs are created for the sake of creating jobs (a symptom of past bureaucracies / legislation / remaining inertia from 20th century employment practices) - we increasingly overproduce and over consume because of our economic model and increased efficiency over time - the employment system is shifting from full time to part time freelancing type employment, which can be inhumane without the proper framework in place (basic income) - we need to change our antiquated view of work where we think every able bodied person should work to one where we see work as optional and less centralized - we need to think of a new economic system or else things will start getting ugly and this is true regardless of whether you think future automation will displace or replace humans",culekhe,378.9594373707879,1,1440991550,22,7,40041,0,39.401595220594004,1487.0,2326.0,43.0,3,0.06976744186046512,0.06976744186046512,0.13953488372093023,0.46511627906976744,0.0,0.023255813953488372,0.023255813953488372,0.023255813953488372,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.11627906976744186,0.0,0.930232558139535,0.06056683735531589,0.21587088096839274,0.0,0,0.0,1502,76.35,72.98,43.64,47.97,34.14,21.17,88.15,50.07,11.25,5.93,0.73,2.13,0.60,0.07,2.40,5.33,6.52,14.58,8.39,4.73,5.79,1.40,15.05,5.46,3.53,1.46,1.40,3.73,4.66,2.93,1.73,0.13,0.73,0.60,8.52,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.20,12.72,2.93,2.60,1.60,2.46,1.33,2.86,1.53,0.73,0.33,0.40,0.60,0.07,0.53,0.00,0.00,8.85,2.80,2.73,1.86,1.26,0.47,2.40,12.85,1.26,15.18,2.06,7.66,5.39,7.92,0.47,0.13,1.40,0.07,0.13,0.40,0.13,0.00,0.07,0.13,0.07,12.72,2.80,3.06,0.53,0.13,0.07,0.00,0.80,0.40,0.80,2.66,1.46

t3_3a27yg,"i am late to comment on this, but as a father of a deaf child i feel a need to chime in. if for no other reason in that at some point in our lives it may be my son on the other side of this scenario. i am basing my comments on the assumption only deafness and not any other special need is at play here. at the time of posting i am going to try to change your &#8710; back at least in the sense of repercussions and kicking out the family. don?t worry about the theater. they have policies in place that their lawyers have approved. i would never apologize for my son?s deafness. but, i do have to understand that it will play a role in social interaction especially in public situations. i believe the parents should decide if it is appropriate for him to see that movie or not. do all parents automatically know what is best or appropriate for their child? of course not. i can only speak for my sons and our situation and each parent should be able to decide for their own case. right or wrong. my son is only two years old and i would not take him to a movie like jurassic world. however, my wife and i are looking to take him to his first movie in about two weeks. his older brother wants to see the new pixar film. my son can sit and watch an entire animated film at home, he loves cars and despicable me. it keeps his attention and he understands ?sit down? and ?quiet? when we sign it to him. he is as well behaved as much as a two year old can be expected to be in public. we are going on a weekday and attending the first showing of the day as opposed to packed saturday night. honestly, all of this forethought isn?t for his consideration. it is for the peace of mind my wife and i will have in attempting to enjoy a family outing. if he acts up during the movie, then one of us will remove him while the other sits with his older brother and watches the remainder of the film. if my son was being disruptive like you described, neither my wife nor myself would be able to enjoy ourselves. if it is truly bothering you and you can?t enjoy the movie that you paid for, then let the movie theatre know. find a manager and explain yourself, hopefully that person will have enough experience and maybe even some training on handling this scenario. ada laws require equal access and treatment. by law they have to accommodate his disability, but not his disruptive behavior. however you handle this, don?t approach the parents yourself. trust me, they know their child has special needs. if they are socially conscious of it, then they will act on their own or if a theatre employee says something. chances are in this situation they probably have tuned him out and will probably react badly to you pointing it out to them. i know if we were approached by someone giving their opinion on how we should raise/treat/control/educate our kid my hot blooded italian wife would be a lot more disruptive than my son ever would be. unless you are a parent of a kid that has special needs you don?t know the feeling associated with hearing that news for the first time. you don?t know the misery of sitting and pacing in waiting room for multiple surgeries. you don?t know the hours and hours spent on therapy, audiology, doctors appointments, sign language classes. you don?t know the stress of lost work and pay because you need to make these appointments driving all over town. you don?t know the struggles with insurance companies and everything you have to pay for out of pocket. you don?t know the fights with schools districts, ifsps and later ieps. you don?t know how draining it can be to try to teach someone that has no concept of volume how to be quiet when appropriate. this trip to the movies could be a reward for hard work or hitting a milestone or accomplishment. it may have been something this kid specifically asked his parents for. everything i just said above isn?t to dissuade you from doing something. it is just a bit of perspective on the other side of your experience. to us, being deaf isn?t a disability for our son. we treat him like we do our hearing son. sometimes being told to be quiet when you are noisy at the movies is part of growing up and realizing that the world doesn?t revolve around you. tl;dr: my son is deaf. let me decide what is and isn?t appropriate. don?t tell them to be quiet yourself. ask the theater to do something about it or ask for a refund. edit: formatting edit #2: i suck at formatting",cs98bq1,1326.5995616214204,1,1434518961,259,37,14179,0,72.97801154237331,829.0,1150.0,51.0,1,0.0,0.0,0.09803921568627451,0.0784313725490196,0.0,0.0196078431372549,0.0,0.0392156862745098,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09803921568627451,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.03733111333111333,0.22677925211097708,0.0,0,0.0,852,55.55,86.51,26.62,49.82,16.38,16.55,88.38,56.81,17.49,11.97,3.64,1.64,2.82,2.23,1.64,5.52,5.75,14.55,9.27,3.52,7.39,1.17,16.08,3.64,2.00,0.94,1.06,1.88,3.64,2.46,1.17,0.47,0.35,0.23,15.49,2.93,0.00,0.47,3.76,13.85,3.40,1.06,2.93,4.23,1.29,3.99,3.40,0.70,1.88,0.47,1.29,0.00,1.17,0.00,0.00,9.04,3.76,1.53,3.05,0.82,0.23,1.17,12.32,1.88,11.38,1.41,6.22,3.87,2.46,2.23,0.47,0.70,0.00,0.00,0.23,0.12,0.00,0.00,0.12,0.00,9.39,5.87,2.11,0.35,0.23,0.12,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.70

t3_2xrgw2,"i would distinguish between ""business schools"", graduate programs within serious universities that offer mba degrees, and undergraduate degree programs that offer a ba in ""business"". it really is not possible for business schools to be antithetical to ""the purpose of universities"", assuming you mean by that the modern research university that was founded in germany in the 1800s and brought to the us at the end of that century. one of the first professional areas that the brand-new german-style universities focused on were business: six of the biggest business schools were founded in this era. treating administration, management, and entrepreneurship as scientific problems you could study, understand and teach were part of the broader approach to institutionalizing research. > moreover, business school does not develop critical thinking skills found in other disciplines, but rather cultivates a sense that the world exists of cutthroats and social darwinism. eh, i do not see the case studies they do in mba programs as any more suspicious than the ones jd or md students look at. meanwhile, the actual research done by professors at business schools is in many cases extremely good. i do not think you can make a principled objection to either the students or the professors. > i feel as though most people who go to college to ""study"" business are really just in it for the money - there is absolutely no passion about their studies to be found within. well, there are lots of passionless students everywhere in universities. it is a general problem. at least people who think their studies will make them rich, and are also very greedy, are *motivated*. greed is a passion, after all. as for business course for undergraduates - i agree, that's like vocational school. not that there should not he vocational schools, but that it has nothing to do with the unique and positive aspects of universities.

t3_39xc0u,"two things... first if you want to move to nyc, you should know that nyc does not want you. you walk too slow, you talk too slow, you probably brought a car you can't park; much less drive. you are going to bitch and moan about prices, and eat at chain restaurants named after days of the week. to the folks in the city... you are just an asshole. slow when you should be fast, fast when you should be slow, and always talking shit. you will notice on your drive into the city that the tolls are one way. this is so there is no barrier to you getting out. seriously, there are 10 million people in the city at almost any time and only 8 million live there. nyc does not want you. nyc wants the people that live there to be invested in their neighborhood. rent control does that because they know that they are not getting kicked out because some whiter folks want to move in. you know you can't find a less expensive place, so you look into ways you can improve or keep your neighborhood from turning into a cess pool. barring an extreme event like the introduction of an extremely inexpensive, powerful, highly addictive drug this helps. (although i accept that a case can be made that the permanence also encourages gangs based on territory... but tbh those happen everywhere.) ""white flight"" was not as big of an issue for nyc as it was for other cities in part because of rent control. rent control is also going to phase out on its own as those living in rent controlled apartments age and pass away. rent stabilization on the other hand is a statewide thing. it is also needed statewide. although each municipality gets to decide if it is needed in that particular city. first reason i can think of to answer the question of ""why is it needed?"" is the suny system. while most states have two or three cities for their state colleges... ny has over 60. for comparison uc has only 9. there are more people in california than there are in ny. for landlords of a less than honest and forthright disposition college students are low hanging fruit. rent increases for sub-standard multi-unit housing because they know parents or loans are going to pay the rent, and the students do not know better. they are just happy they found a place for themselves and their 3 best friends they will not be able to stand at the end of the year. rent control/stabilization helps to prevent these abuses. if the educated college students have issues with understanding their rights imagine how screwed poor less educated people are. yeah... so point one in a nutshell is that the city does not want you, but is willing to invest in the people that already call it home. break for specific ideas: > * current units cannot be transferred to a new tenant. if the original tenant on the lease at the time of the decontrol law vacates the unit, the unit can be listed by the landlord at market rates. currently, other occupants related to the lessor can inherit the lease, meaning units pass down in families indefinitely. so guy gets an apartment, signs the lease (original tenant) gets married and dies in a horrible accident.. now his widow not only has to deal with her husbands death, but her rent goes up too because she was not an ""original tenant""? damn, that's just cold. this is the scenario that legacy rent control protects. yes a kid might move back into their parents apartment, but generally they will have their own lives and careers by the time their parents pass away/ vacate the apartment. by keeping legacy controls vague and open, we allow for some abuse (in the opinions of some) but the cost of that abuse is still less than the cost of elimination of the benefit, and the confusion/expense created by trying to create/enforce caveats for every special situation. > * newly constructed or rented units are not subject to any controls. in terms of specific ""rent control""... this has been the situation for forty some odd years. stabilization continues, but exempting new construction would encourage the destruction/reconstruction or re-habbing of existing housing in order to create new/newly rented units. ex 10 story rent controlled/stabilized building with 200 tenants is razed to build a 15 story building that houses 300... the original 200 now need to find another home and will not be able to afford to move back into the apartment that now occupies the same space as their old home. > * rents in all controlled units can rise by up to 5% per year. confused here as currently can't landlords petition for a change of up to 7.5% for a year? and at 5% a year.. in ten years time there will be a ~50% discrepancy between the increase in rent and inflation (using a ballpark average recent rate of 2% per year) > * rent decontrol be coupled with large scale upzoning to allow more housing to come on to the market. this will include infill construction in nycha housing projects where developers are willing to pay market rates for the land. housing projects, while well-intentioned, have a serious history of segregation and exacerbating the effects of criminal activity on a community. while rent-control works by putting people from different socio-economic backgrounds in close proximity, public houses homogenizes the socio-economic backgrounds of the people living there. this is not a good thing for our society. a ghetto (in the classical definition not the ""black neighborhood"" definition) is essentially a combination of /r spacedicks and /r circlejerk. the worst aspects of the community have a very high short term reward at the expense of long term growth and the community in general. > * buildings which received mitchell-lama or other tax subsidies must pay back the subsidies with interest before decontrolling units which were built as a condition of the subsidy, on a pro-rated basis. subsidies with conditions need to have the conditions met to continue, although allowing negotiations for a subsidy to turn into a loan existing is not a bad idea as situations change and being able to respond to that change is crucial. the rental rights in ny and nyc specifically were created because of abuses by landlords. the ""property rights"" of a tenant were established to protect against those abuses. todays landlords are not more moral and caring than their 19th/10th century counterparts, and eliminating those rights will again normalize those abuses. point 2: without some form of rent control or stabilization rents would initially increase (and drastically) however the people who make the city actually run would be forced out of their homes. there would be a lag time because evictions take time, but suddenly there wouldn't be anybody to do the jobs that need doing in the city. without basic things like the subway, trash collection, waiters at restaurants, actors performing in off-broadway shows.. the bubble created by the elimination of controls/stabilization would pop. this would crash the market leaving the speculative landlords who were so eager to see controls removed holding worthless property. while it is possible that the people would just move back... it is doubtful. look at detroit. that is what happens to a city when it is primary draw/ industry is destroyed. nyc needs its artists and the working class that generates good artists. those people need someplace to live that they can afford. nobody wants to go to nyc to look at a stock broker or accountant. sorry to all those stockbrokers out there. you might be nice, but you are not interesting to watch. a broadway show.. even the cheesy trite pieces like ""cats"" are entertaining. what would america have in terms of art without nyc? mark twain, gospel, folk, country, and bluegrass. that's pretty much it. ok... chicago might have a claim on popularizing/ spreading the blues beyond the mississippi flood plains, but it is hotly contested by nyc. jazz would have languished in new orleans if it weren't for the cotton clubs and radio broadcasts out of ny. punk as an idea was around for a bit, but nyc and cbgb's specifically were its physical and spiritual home. but without the content from ny, hollywood would have had nothing to film until the mid 70's. no lenny bruce, no george carlin, no late night tv to speak of although carson was a west coast guy the gig originated in the east. rock and roll didn't have a meaningful home until alan freed hit nyc. without nyc's unique combination of blue collar and upper upper white collar experiences most of the art and entertainment we know and take for granted today wouldn't exist. that is not an exaggeration, if anything it is an understatement. yes, atlanta, seattle, st. louis, san francisco and other cities have had some major influences in specific time periods, but we keep coming back to nyc. why? because more than any other city in the country the rich and poor live side by side. taking the same trains, complaining about the same weather, sharing the same barstools. because rent control and stabilization are inefficient, sloppy, and have all of what you perceive to be negative effects. so while there might be some short term benefits to the pockets of certain landlords... the long term effects will decimate the city at worst, make it bland and irrelevant at best.",cs7s05a,2545.0378826486453,1,1434440931,142,19,28725,0,63.28713009361407,1573.0,2378.0,102.0,9,0.058823529411764705,0.0,0.14705882352941177,0.29411764705882354,0.0,0.0,0.00980392156862745,0.0196078431372549,0.00980392156862745,0.0,0.00980392156862745,0.0196078431372549,0.049019607843137254,0.0,0.6176470588235294,NaN,0.26255562619198985,0.0,0,0.0,1608,82.99,53.98,33.66,40.29,15.92,20.90,83.96,49.38,7.96,3.30,0.12,0.25,1.49,0.25,1.18,4.66,8.27,14.12,8.46,4.29,6.53,2.30,13.99,5.66,2.67,0.87,1.68,2.05,4.42,2.55,1.74,0.19,0.81,0.19,6.53,0.56,0.44,0.19,0.25,14.24,1.93,3.36,2.36,2.74,0.93,4.54,1.12,0.68,0.12,0.12,1.18,0.19,0.62,0.06,0.31,7.65,1.55,1.18,3.61,1.18,0.56,1.74,10.63,1.12,14.49,2.67,7.65,4.85,2.36,1.24,3.73,3.23,0.19,0.12,0.87,0.31,0.19,0.25,0.06,0.00,16.04,7.46,3.30,0.12,0.06,0.31,0.00,0.62,0.87,0.75,0.75,1.80

t3_31p2g2,"so i will take a stab at this, and i will go in a different direction than a lot of other people who have already made the points i woulda made (ie. ignoring racism that already exists, affirmative action, support for status quo etc). let me explain, based on my own experience as a white dude (i'm assuming you are also white), why colorblindness is a bad idea. i grew up in the ""celebrate everyone for who they are as individuals"" 80s and 90s. that meant that i was fed a steady doctrine of ""racism is bad, only see people for who they are under their skin, never the color of their skin."" this, essentially, is the colorblind ideology that many millenials (particularly white millenials but of course not only limited to them) have grown up on. and that, my friend, has led me through a *lot* of uncomfortable cognitive dissonance. i grew up thinking ""oh, i can never treat or look at people differently based on the color of their skin because everyone is equal."" but then what happened when i saw many black people acting in different ways than most white people i knew did? that didn't make sense! everyone is equal, everyone is the same besides their skin color! why should not they be more like me? i felt shitty about wondering why. so i pressed it down, afraid to ever talk about race. i knew i was not allowed to talk about race because talking about race is ""racist."" it is uncomfortable and confusing. and if you think i am the only one, there is actually been a considerable amount of study done on the [harmful psychosocial effects of white people living in a racist society and expereincing this type of dissonance](yeah, here is the kicker: races in the us, by and large, *are* different. whoa, hold your horses right??? that goes against everything i know to be good and true in this world! ok, let me clear up one thing right quick. by different i do not in any way shape or form mean biologically. there is no evidence for that whatsoever. nor is there any evidence that black people are less intelligent. all that phrenology white nationalist bs can go take a hike. i do mean culturally. for example, you might remember how there was a huge uproar about oakland schools teaching ""ebonics"" as a second language right? well, actually most linguists seem to think that what many black americans speak [constitutes its own language or vernacular](anecdotally you may know this. but it feels a little ""racist"" to point it out right? this is the problem with colorblindness. it is not racist to point out cultural differences that exist. not only is it not racist, *it's actually devaluing of the black experience if we don't.* colorblindness basically says, ""black people should be more like white people, and if they are not there is something wrong with them."" it says ""people with a different culture should be treated as if they are full, willing participants in white culture even if they are not."" but that does not make sense. the black experience by and large is *fundamentally* different from the white experience in this country. i bet you can rail off right now several average ""differences"" you have anecdotally observed among most black people you have ever met and most white people you have ever met. shit, we do not even live together. even ""diverse"" urban cities in the us are heavily segregated. our schools are more segregated than they have been since jim crow ended. to ignore this is to ignore reality. because not only do black people face different levels of discrimination than white people, by and large they also talk differently, eat different food, consume different entertainment, have different types of family structures, worship religion differently, learn differently etc etc. it is not racist to point those things out. it is factual. now this may seem like i am advocating on behalf of ""segregation."" not at all. i am advocating that we recognize difference as valuable and an essential part of the multi cultural fabric of the us. white supremacists have hijacked the ""acknowledging difference"" thing and made it entirely pejorative. fuck them. as jeremiah wright (yeah that jeremiah wright) said, ""we're different, but not deficient."" i would highly recommend you watch [his awesome and hilarious speech about why colorblindness is damaging and actually serves to ignore black people](hi arguments for affirmative action are twofold: one they help black people reach past the discrimination they face in the educational system and elsewhere in order to have a chance at the educational experience. additionally, and this is where the colorblindness thing comes in, he advocates on behalf of it so that *more people with different viewpoints and experiences and culture have access to and influence the culture of academia and thought*. that's the opposite of colorblindness. that's saying ""we're different, and we need more of us."" i believe this wholeheartedly. i have not brought up ""privilege"" and institutional bias against people of color here intentionally. those are emotional topics, and i didn't want to frame what i said in that light. however, hopefully it makes a little more sense by now how these words reflect a colorblind mindset. part of privilege is assuming that your culture and your experience is default and ""normal."" that's why it is easier to think you are colorblind if you are white. much harder if you are not. black people know what white culture is. they are likely bombarded with it every day. but white people get to ignore black culture because, unless you get your occasional fix from hip hop or other commodified black pop culture, you likely do not even have to acknowledge it exists. basically, racism is not *acknowledging* difference. racism is *discriminating against* difference. one way to discriminate against difference is to pretend it does not exist. that's basically implying that any difference that does exist is shameful. nah screw that. difference is valuable and deserves to be celebrated. acknowledging racial difference is my anti racism. if you would like more nuanced, researched, and thoughtful reading on the issue than the article you posted, i would highly recommend you check out [this book](it is truly excellent.",cq3sydv,642.6913362907403,1,1428410080,117,18,12464,0,60.39242301719062,1052.0,1634.0,71.0,6,0.09859154929577464,0.0,0.09859154929577464,0.22535211267605634,0.0,0.014084507042253521,0.014084507042253521,0.014084507042253521,0.0,0.014084507042253521,0.0,0.0,0.014084507042253521,0.04225352112676056,0.5352112676056338,NaN,0.2224334600760456,0.0,0,0.0,1056,38.15,49.62,56.42,27.34,15.30,21.40,88.16,53.50,15.53,8.14,3.22,1.04,1.99,0.19,1.70,7.39,4.17,11.84,10.42,5.59,6.53,2.65,17.14,8.14,5.11,1.52,0.47,3.03,4.36,2.18,2.08,0.47,0.47,0.00,11.36,0.09,0.19,0.00,0.19,18.84,3.60,2.46,1.80,3.41,1.99,8.14,6.82,4.45,0.66,0.76,1.61,0.85,0.19,0.19,0.28,5.11,1.89,0.38,1.99,0.76,0.38,3.31,13.07,0.66,9.00,1.23,5.97,1.70,1.33,0.57,0.09,0.09,0.19,0.00,1.33,0.47,0.19,0.38,0.19,0.09,18.75,5.97,4.36,0.19,0.00,0.66,0.28,0.00,3.03,1.04,1.14,2.08

t3_36adfo,"reallocating funds from the military is a bit of a false dichotomy. the us has not had a problem paying for other parts of the budget because of the military - in fact, from our [distribution of federal spending](we see that the military is not even the second largest line item in the federal budget, behind health care and social security. in addition, a lot of this forgets that us government spending is more than just federal spending - the us government grants a lot of autonomy to states on how much they spend and how they spend on things like education. the state governments spend a lot more on education (at rates varying state by state), leading the us to [spend more on education as a nation](than any other nation in the world. also, the us has been able to spend more than it takes in from taxes (which does mean more debt) because it is capable of doing so - most of its debt is held by americans in the us dollar. thus, taking money away from the military does not mean it will suddenly be reallocated to these other areas. in fact, the military as a % of the gdp and % of the national budget has steadily decreased since the height of the cold war. [we're at the lowest point sine ww2](-- meanwhile, our federal budget has actually *expanded* tremendously in these other areas, such as education and health care, thus [dropping the military from nearly 70% of the federal budget](in the 1950s to < 20% today. thus, the us is spending far more than it ever has on education, health care, and other areas as a country, as a % of its gdp, as a % of its federal budget, etc. than the military - and so cutting the military budget, which is a significant but small part of that pie, is not getting to the root of the problem: why we are spending so much money on so little in terms of results. ---- finally, i would add that cutting the military without reassessing what we as a country want to do in foreign policy is exactly what the problem with the government cutting spending on the military is doing right now: they have not reined in their expectations of the military. the military spends over 42% of its budget (including war funds) on personnel pay and benefits for its over 3 million servicemembers and civilian employees. that's nearly 1% of the entire us population, which makes it the single largest employer in the us. people are happy to talk about cutting procurement of new weapons - and yet, procurement is only 19% of the annual budget, with another 12-13% being spent on r&d. and yet, by cutting procurement of weapons, we are left with ever-increasingly aging aircraft (the average air force aircraft age is over 25 years old), increasing maintenance costs (the second largest military expenditure is on maintenance and operations to include training). thus, cutting the military spending is not just about cutting buying new weapons - it must include a cut at all levels including personnel pay, benefits, r&d, operations, maintenance, etc. in order to keep the organization balanced. also, the us military spending is high not because congress wants it to be high - not entirely, at least. in fact, the president releases a new national security strategy every four years which outlines what the president wants to be able to do in the world. during the cold war, each presidential administration kept to the strategy of ""win two major wars at a time"" - and thus, cold war spending was as high as it was. during the clinton post-cold war era, it became ""win-hold-win"": win one war while holding the line in another war, and then winning that one decisively. as thus, the us saw its cold war era level of winning two wars simultaneously cut to winning ""1.5"" wars a time - accordingly the us carrier fleet shrank from 15 aircraft carriers to 11 during the 90s. the bush administration and now obama administration have kept it pegged pretty similarly. however, they have been willing to cut the military budget the last few years while keeping our expectations of what the military can do at a high. for all the talk about how we should be stopping groups like isis, boko haram, etc., we need to remember that our capabilities to do so only exist because we are willing to have those forces ready and available anywhere in the world at a moment's notice, something most countries cannot do. but being able to do that also means maintaining a large worldwide presence of ships and bases, large aircraft fleets (to include transports and tanker aircraft), aircraft carriers, etc. as thus, military spending will only realistically be cut (and to no guarantee any of that money would be reallocated to social programs) when the us is willing to reduce its goals on the world stage. and as europe increasingly cuts its military budget (to which almost every single non-us nato member has failed to meet its 2% of gdp pledge), and as [non-democratic nations increase their share of world defense spending](the prospect of cutting us spending can only exist if we are willing to rein in our expectations of what the us can and cannot do in an increasingly competitive, and perhaps more dangerous, world.",crc951i,250.00227297952503,1,1431924387,147,12,31182,0,45.81631911262801,879.0,1364.0,30.0,10,0.16666666666666666,0.26666666666666666,0.23333333333333334,0.1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1,0.0,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.0,0.2,0.06666666666666667,1.1666666666666667,0.09865340598099219,0.2025028441410694,0.0,0,0.0,904,87.45,65.49,22.58,14.97,32.29,21.79,86.39,52.10,9.73,4.09,0.11,3.32,0.00,0.00,0.66,5.64,9.29,16.37,7.41,5.20,6.42,1.33,12.28,6.97,3.87,1.66,2.54,3.76,5.20,1.99,2.77,0.00,1.55,0.22,4.98,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,10.62,0.77,2.43,1.66,1.66,1.55,2.88,0.77,0.22,0.00,0.55,0.66,0.00,0.55,0.00,0.11,15.49,3.98,1.99,8.63,1.99,1.00,1.44,9.51,1.00,14.38,1.11,9.07,3.98,3.87,0.00,0.00,4.87,0.00,1.22,0.22,0.00,0.22,0.00,0.00,0.00,17.81,3.21,5.64,0.33,0.00,0.00,0.00,2.43,0.66,0.33,2.32,2.88

(but please realize that negative is a loose term, even an ad that says something bad about another party's policy is ""negative"" even if it does it in a neutral tone. there is a specific term for that: acceptable negative.) most ads tell us the priorities of competing parties and the differences in their policy platforms. they serve a very useful function: to provide voters with information in a simple manner that is easily recalled. points made in debates are not easily recalled since they get lost in the back-and-forth. even negative ads serve a very useful function. they may be ugly, but they are often full of information regarding a political party's position on a policy or a candidate's weaknesses. they are actually scrutinized to a much higher level than positive ads and actually serve an important purpose in getting the public to engage with issues. negative ads are based on policy over personality in a 4:1 ratio, so the media's mania over the overinfluence of negative ads is overblown. in fact, as you can see from the second source i provided canadians do not react favourably towards personal attack ads and all parties are wary of crossing a line and losing votes as a result. some negativity is to be expected, but canadians are pretty nice about it all. plus, there is the simple fact than one party (cpc) is the best at fundraising --probably because it is the only major right-of-centre party-- and it uses that money to produce ads b/w elections, when there is no restriction on spending. by banning attack ads, you are penalizing the other parties from being able to defend themselves from attacks b/w elections. please take a close look at table 7.2 in the first source i have provided - the disparities in spending are shocking. but what about your alternative of more debates? is it really a good idea to have a lot of debates and no ads? i do not think so. i watched the recent maclean's leaders debate and while i enjoyed the debate, i was appalled at the post-debate analysis. the talking heads were discussing which *zinger* really hit home and how it would affect that leader's image. there was another section --the most awful one, in my opinion-- that had a ""[body language expert](analyze the body language of each of the candidates and draw conclusions on their personality **and** policy. it was awful! if the television media actually cared about reporting on policy, i would be with you for all debates all the time. but they boil it down to a competition among leaders that's part of the problem. the media's focus remains on ""the process of politics rather than its substance."" i hope this changes your view. edit: clarity and fixed a link. edit 2: more edits for clarity and grammar.",cudjp1z,357.646439611966,1,1440391323,25,8,8627,0,55.36216669774382,519.0,825.0,31.0,114,0.0,0.03225806451612903,0.22580645161290322,0.2903225806451613,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03225806451612903,0.03225806451612903,0.0,0.6129032258064515,NaN,0.2504816955684008,0.0,0,0.0,534,75.87,47.00,27.52,64.81,17.80,21.16,85.21,52.62,10.49,5.43,2.25,0.19,1.31,0.00,1.69,5.06,8.99,13.30,8.24,5.06,6.18,3.00,13.48,5.81,2.62,0.75,2.06,3.37,8.24,5.06,3.00,0.00,1.31,0.37,8.05,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,15.92,2.62,3.56,1.50,3.00,1.69,5.06,1.50,1.12,0.19,0.19,0.75,0.56,0.00,0.00,0.00,9.74,1.87,2.06,5.24,1.31,0.75,2.43,8.80,0.75,8.99,0.19,6.93,1.87,4.12,1.87,0.19,0.56,0.00,0.00,0.37,0.00,0.37,0.00,0.00,0.00,20.22,4.68,2.62,1.12,0.00,0.75,0.19,2.62,0.94,1.69,1.50,4.12

""revamping"" the phrase is both technically unnecessary and will not help with confusion. it's technically unnecessary because as phrased, the statement *is* true. correlation and causation are different ideas. it is not even a rectangle/square kind of relationship. correlation is *evidence* for or against causation, but it never makes sense to say that a correlation *is a* causation. it is a category error even when the causal relationship *exists*. second, your clarification does not get to the heart of the misunderstandings. everyone already knows the essence of what you are trying to more clearly imply. no one thinks that correlation is somehow evidence *against* causation. that said, the phrase is certainly often used as a copout. if you are trying to argue for causation, correlations on their own are insufficient. to make a really compelling case, you need to hypothesize a mechanism by which the causation takes place, and that hypothesis will yield addition tests to run. if you are arguing against causation, you are right that correlation does not equal causation, but if someone presents a compelling correlation that you have no explanation for, you are argument is going to look pretty weak. but none of this implies a fundamental problem with the phrase itself.",csbe584,754.086676636049,1,1434680338,22,7,2277,0,44.432155172413815,232.0,405.0,16.0,54,0.1875,0.0,0.1875,0.3125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6875,0.011794871794871795,0.23706896551724138,0.0,0,0.0,232,55.58,46.55,45.09,25.77,14.50,28.88,91.81,54.74,11.21,4.31,0.43,0.00,3.45,0.00,0.43,6.90,8.62,10.78,10.78,5.17,6.47,4.31,17.67,5.17,3.45,1.29,0.86,2.59,4.31,2.16,2.16,0.00,1.29,0.00,8.19,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,34.05,9.91,8.19,2.16,6.03,3.02,7.76,2.59,1.29,0.86,0.00,0.86,0.43,0.43,0.00,0.00,5.17,1.29,0.86,1.29,1.29,0.86,1.29,14.66,1.29,4.31,0.86,1.72,1.72,0.43,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,19.83,6.90,4.74,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,2.59,0.43,0.00,5.17

t3_3fnpby,"i have 1500 hours in tf2, although admittedly have fallen out with the game over the last year. your opinion is not an uncommon one, and i believe the developers have even stated that the sniper added the least to the game out of all the classes, but i think you need to articulate your reasoning better before i or anyone else can attempt to change your view. the only point (from a gameplay perspective) i see you have provided is that the sniper is a long range pick class; and there already exists a far more dynamic pick class, the spy. however, the spy is an inconsistent, and thus ineffective, pick class. the range, preparation, patience, luck required to get a backstab on an attentive target (especially when players are actively searching and attempting to stop the spy from reaching a medic or heavy), combined with the fact that you are unlikely to survive after the pick in question is completed, again provided the team is competent enough to have a pyro near the combo to flush you out, makes the spy class hard to play and have little impact on the game. if you have ever watched competitive highlander, you will notice the spy does very little for most of the game; usually their role is literally that of a spy, to sit with a cloak and dagger and report on the enemy's movements. in 6s, spy is the least used class besides engineer. it is because as a pick class, the spy is ineffective most of the time. if you are pub stomping or whatever, then you will obviously dominate the other team, but a halfway organized team can shut down a decent spy. it's necessary to have a class that can provide picks based on purely skill and not luck or the competency of your enemies. there needs to be a pick class that cannot be safeguarded against with little effort, at the cost of less role diversity. that is why the sniper is a very important class to have.",ctqb537,365.85671791215435,1,1438663034,28,6,2722,0,54.74594873663753,343.0,499.0,12.0,3,0.25,0.08333333333333333,0.25,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.08333333333333333,0.08333333333333333,0.08333333333333333,0.08333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.08333333333333333,0.08333333333333333,0.0,1.4166666666666663,0.19076479076479078,0.25072886297376096,0.0,0,0.0,344,88.37,67.90,29.29,35.95,28.67,17.44,86.92,55.23,8.72,5.23,1.45,0.00,3.49,0.00,0.29,3.49,13.37,13.08,9.88,4.36,6.40,0.87,14.83,4.94,2.91,0.87,0.58,2.33,3.49,2.03,1.45,0.00,0.87,0.00,8.14,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,16.28,2.03,4.36,1.45,4.36,2.33,4.65,1.74,1.16,0.00,0.58,0.29,0.00,0.29,0.00,0.00,7.56,2.33,3.78,2.03,1.45,0.29,2.62,14.24,1.16,11.05,0.87,6.40,3.78,6.40,2.91,0.00,0.29,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,11.63,3.49,5.81,0.00,0.58,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.58,1.16,0.00

t3_36n9kq,"reasons to get excited for hillary clinton: **1 - she has an electoral juggernaut.** if you know anything at all about american politics, you know that winning is everything. the candidate with 50.1% of the vote gets to carry out 100% of their agenda, and conversely the losing candidate gets nothing. anyone who wants to see a non-republican in office (due to supreme court appointments or for whatever reason) should be absolutely thrilled to support a candidate with such massive electoral potential. **2 - she has a feminist hero and icon.** a lot of people focus on the fact that hillary clinton is a woman, but perhaps even more important is that she has a staunch feminist--and a feminist icon at that. now obviously this point will vary depending on your view of feminism, but i assume i am talking to left-leaning individuals to start with. from the time of her commencement address at wellesley college, hillary clinton (then hillary rodham) has shattered numerous glass ceilings and been an unflagging advocate for women's rights both domestically and around the world. to get just a little taste of her global impact, i encourage you to check out the [no ceilings project]((a joint report done by the clinton foundation and the gates foundation) and also her [recent speech at the women in the world summit](her unique perspective and historic advocacy on women's issues would be absolutely transformational in the white house. **3 - she has a liberal progressive and a pragmatist.** pragmatism is the whipping boy of politics these days. it seems everyone on both the left and the right is yearning for ideological purity. but not only is pragmatism the lifeblood of politics, pragmatism does not have to be at odds with ideology. this relates back to point #1--winning is everything. if you want to, say, combat growing income inequality in america, you are infinitely more likely to make that happen by supporting clinton than by supporting warren or sanders. that's not a compromise of ideology--that's a strong adherence to it. but beyond that, the claims that clinton is a moderate are grossly overstated.

t3_3g1fhs,"here is the problem with chemical incapacitation: there is a reason why, in the real world, surgeries require an anesthesiologist to keep you unconscious but not dead during surgery, and why they are paid so highly: rendering someone unconscious without killing or permanently injuring them is very very difficult to do. there is a very narrow band, which is different for each individual person, that puts them under without taking away the possibility of waking up. okay, so what, why can't we make a standard dose for a gun? the theory of police having a gun is that they use it when someone is threatening someone else with lethal force. if someone has a gun on either the officer or a civilian, if someone has a knife and is rushing the officer or a civilian, the officer has the gun to respond with appropriate force. let's look at what happens with a tranq gun in 3 scenarios. in the very unlikely event that you have the exact right dosage: guy passes out. probably not immediately, but maybe. dosage too high: you kill them. not a huge difference from the gun. dosage too low: uh oh, you still have a violent person charging you with a knife, and not enough time to draw a better weapon. you are probably going to get injured, and very well might die yourself. the best worst-case scenario is the same as a gunshot wound. the worst worst-case scenario is cops getting killed left and right. the best case scenario does not have great odds, given the way dosages work with tranquilizers. it's seriously just not a feasible weapon system, otherwise someone would be marketing it, selling it, and making a fortune.",cttzgzr,103.43828865454597,1,1438895617,48,11,-21627,0,60.81636513157895,285.0,431.0,16.0,64,0.0,0.0625,0.1875,0.375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.625,0.08261904761904762,0.2807017543859649,0.0,0,0.0,288,65.47,56.90,20.11,3.12,18.00,20.49,87.50,56.25,10.42,4.86,0.00,0.69,2.43,0.00,1.74,5.56,11.81,10.07,8.68,8.33,6.25,3.12,14.93,6.25,3.82,2.43,0.35,0.69,7.29,2.43,4.86,0.35,2.43,0.35,9.03,0.00,0.35,0.00,0.35,16.32,0.35,3.12,1.39,6.60,0.35,7.29,0.35,0.35,0.00,0.00,3.47,0.69,3.47,0.00,0.00,9.72,0.69,1.39,5.21,2.43,2.08,1.04,11.81,1.04,9.72,1.39,6.25,2.08,1.39,0.35,0.00,1.39,0.00,2.08,1.39,0.00,0.00,0.35,1.04,0.00,14.93,5.21,5.90,1.74,0.00,0.35,0.00,0.69,0.00,1.04,0.00,0.00
t3_3g1fhs,"i have been trained to use tranquilizers on animals, and they are a nightmare to get right. first off, the doses of even the best drugs tend to be very sensitive. we have to estimate the weight of the animal and put the correct amount of the drug in the needle. while a good drug can account by us being off by a bit, it does not account for the danger of using a dose for a creature twice the size or bigger. as humans have a large range of potential body sizes, that means that the police would not be able to have the darts pre-loaded and ready to go, but rather have to load up a dart with the drug while in pursuit and estimating their size. that changes the time between deciding to use the weapon and using it from a few seconds to a few minutes (if not longer), which can mean the difference between life and death in a situation where using either weapon is needed. >and if something happens like in the scenes we see in the movies, where the criminal takes a hostage and police officers can't shoot because they are afraid of hurting the hostage, wouldn't this make everything easier? they could've just shoot without worrying about anything, and make both the hostage and the criminal collapse? a 250 lbs man holding a 100 lbs woman still means that if she gets a dart meant for him in her, she will likely die. secondly, even in a perfectly healthy subject, there is a great deal of possibility of complications. these drugs work by relaxing the muscles and/or paralyzing them, but that also applies to muscles like the diaphragm and heart. when sedating an animal, we have to closely monitor their breathing and temperature to make sure that the drug is not causing problems and potentially administer counter agents. third, many humans already have drugs in their system, both legal and illegal. without knowing exactly what they have in them, it is impossible to know how the tranquilizer will interact. it may make it useless, it may make it deadly, it may drive them into a berserker rage. without their medical history in from of us and a pharmacist, we cannot know. fourth, tranquilizers take a while to take effect. it sometimes takes as long as several minutes after the drugs enter their system for it to impact them. with an animal, we can easily sit back and observe them from a distance until they collapse, but with a criminal it will just give him a few minutes of doing whatever dangerous activity he is already engaged in. some people may react to being hit by a dart with anger and become more violent. also, if they happen to know the drug the police use, they may have a syringe of a counter-agent with them and be able to use the time to nullify the effect. fifth, darts are far less accurate than a regular bullet. distance must be carefully estimated and applied to whatever launcher is used. overestimating distance means the dart will not hit with enough force and not penetrate skin or will drop too much and miss entirely. underestimating distance means the dart not dropping enough and overshooting the target or hitting and doing severe damage with the impact. this means that the chances of the police hitting their target at all are very low, and they must engage from a much shorter distance. finally, the darts are very difficult to get to inject even when they hit the target. often times simply fur is enough to stop a successful hit from injecting the drug and cause it to simply spray the outside of the animal. a heavy coat, leather jacket, or a wide range of other possible clothing options can easily do the same thing and prevent the drug from entering the system of the target even on an accurate shot. overall, if i am going up against gun bearing criminal with either a tranquilizer gun or a baseball bat, i will take the bat because i will be more likely to win and i will be less likely to kill the criminal in the event of a victory.",ctu95h3,438.5284413213247,1,1438910934,48,11,-6310,0,58.609813559322035,708.0,1040.0,30.0,40,0.1,0.0,0.16666666666666666,0.16666666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1,0.03333333333333333,0.6,0.06944890808988172,0.24293785310734464,0.0,0,0.0,714,85.18,50.00,16.96,28.10,23.80,19.05,86.69,55.32,9.80,5.46,0.70,0.98,0.00,0.84,2.94,4.34,11.76,14.01,8.26,3.92,7.84,1.82,14.99,5.04,2.80,1.26,0.98,2.80,5.46,2.80,2.66,0.28,0.84,0.56,6.16,0.00,0.00,0.56,0.56,14.85,2.24,3.36,1.96,4.06,1.54,4.62,0.98,0.28,0.00,0.70,3.36,0.84,2.66,0.00,0.14,7.42,1.12,1.54,2.80,2.10,0.98,0.98,10.36,2.24,10.50,1.26,5.88,3.50,1.26,0.42,0.00,0.28,0.00,0.42,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,9.94,3.92,4.48,0.00,0.00,0.28,0.00,0.28,0.00,0.42,0.28,0.28

t3_34gvus,"reposting from /r/politicaldiscussion lets look at his platform from [here](where possible ill use the igm panel to show where consensus stands on issues, where that is not possible ill try to explain what consensus looks like (or indeed if its lacking). > rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure. the us has somewhat under-invested in infrastructure (perhaps mis-invested is a better phrase, the amount of spending we should have been doing is likely around what we have been spending, we have just been spending it on the wrong things) but this problem is overstated significantly, particularly by those using the ""crumbling infrastructure"" phrase. asce use the dot's red list as the basis of their analysis (not to mention the analysis itself its not impartial given who they represent) which largely relies on a misunderstanding on what the phrase ""structurally deficient"" means. while its interpreted as ""dangerous"" it simply means ""does not meet current construction standards"", in many cases (almost all bridges that appear on the list) this is simply that the infrastructure was built prior to an increase in construction standards. most of the items that appear on the dot red list offer no value to replace, they are servicable infrastructure which will continue to function safely until the end of their operational windows. igm have asked the infrastructure question twice, [here](and [here](and both times the results were very similar both times; there are some high multiplier projects available to congress but congress have trouble figuring out what a useful infrastructure project actually is. > addressing climate change no meat on these proposals but this is not a contentious issue among economists (unfortunately igm have only addressed this indirectly [here](and [here](you use a pigouvian tax, you impose it as an excise tax on production & import of goods and that's it (paper dealing with the various policies available [here](direct subsidies (eg additional public spending for green energy) are unnecessary, inefficient and and tend to be externality generating themselves. correcting the pricing of carbon is mostly sufficient to deal with this issue. the only additional policy we should consider is reworking regulatory burden on non-ff energy sources as some (notably nuclear) almost certainly have a regulatory burden much higher then is required to meet public safety concerns. > real tax reform lots of problems in here; there is nothing close to consensus that *income* inequality is actually increasing in the us (see [this](cps does not accurately measure incomes, cpi does not accurately measure inflation across all income groups and as such a straight gini on real incomes results in inequality growth only through data bias (more discussion of this [here](even if it was there is nothing close to consensus that its actually an issue that would need addressing, its not clear there are any negative economic outcomes that result from inequality in advanced economies. corporation taxes consensus absolutely does exist that they are terrible, they are paid by neither corporations nor the wealthy (long-run labor is responsible for the majority) and they are extremely [distortionary](in the case of the us distortionary cost is well in excess of revenue. eliminating them entirely would result in [wage growth and other desirable improvements](the revenue could be offset by a small tweak in the top rate of income tax. a good tax proposal which sanders would never support would be the x-tax system discussed in [here](the problem with having strong opinions about how specific taxes function is that people tend to be unwilling to consider they may be mistaken. > protecting the most vulnerable americans also lots of problems in here. on the poverty issue i have no idea if the us has the highest rate of poverty in the world and neither does anyone else, no one actually measures real poverty as their official poverty measure and everyone measures it differently (eg us uses a basket of groceries from 1955 indexed to cpi-u, much of the rest of the world uses a function of median income). we do know that real poverty is declining in the us, more should absolutely be done but i am not sure arguing from the false starting point that the us has the highest rates of poverty in the world is particularly useful. social security desperately needs replacing with something else. most countries migrated to multi-tiered system decades ago where they combine a means tested public pension system to ensure an income floor exists for retirees with mandatory retirement savings. there are lots of designs which would work well, australia started migrating to such a system in the 90's which is particularly interesting. ill address medicare/aid in a later point. for the more generalized poverty point while there are certainly programs which should continue to exist consensus on poverty management is very much we should replace all current forms of cash transfer with an [nit](this is something that has been [evident](since the 60's. > health care as a right for all now in to my area and most of his points here are either incorrect or misrepresenting reality. on the spending side the absolute amount or the pc amount are largely red herrings, estimates for the us ""premium"" stand at between 20 and 30 percent, are largely unchanged over the last generation (almost all the increase in cost is technology related) and its causes (and solutions) are typically misunderstood. on the outcomes side its largely impossible to directly compare countries as once you reach the advanced economy point health outcomes will be modified by lifestyle factors much more strongly then they will be health efficacy. some [very limited](useful comparisons have been made which suggest the us may do well if we could actually control for the lifestyle bias effect. the us pays the most pc for drugs because we consume the most drugs, on a per-drug-unit basis both germany & japan are comparable in cost to the us (us is slightly higher then both for on-patent drugs, us is slightly lower then germany for generic drugs and much lower then japan for generics). one of the ways we end up paying more is that we do not limit the drugs available to physicians like other countries do, some drugs available in the us do not meet cost/efficacy standards elsewhere and as such are only available in the us. the form of single-payer which is possible in the us (insurance) would do very little to deal with the inefficiencies inherent in the system, would likely increase the cost of healthcare and more generally does not make sense. most of the world uses multi-payer universal systems because they lend more flexibility to healthcare and do not compromise health outcomes in the name of cost performance. a meaningful reform package would be to replace the entire system with a german style mp insurance model, no more medicare/aid. > taking on wall st. on the consensus side there is widespread agreement regarding direction this needs to go but not actual policies we should be looking act. you could say there is consensus that the increased basel requirements were good, that the transition to fed stewardship is good and the focus on limiting the use of mbs instruments is good. some people think we need to go further. financial investment does not count towards gdp the comparison is mostly meaningless. there is some evidence that the us has a larger financial sector then is optimal but breaking them up will simply make them weaker and less diversified, far more likely for problems to occur. there is a good analysis of us vs canada (canada is generally considered to have the safest banking sector in the world) [here](which discusses these issues in more detail. one of the interesting ideas is the reemergence of an idea proposed during the depression, written about by friedman in detail much later and something that has been raised in iceland as a possibility for reform. it is [fully

t3_33tz15,"profit in itself is not bad. if you want to get philosophical, all profits (in cases absent rent-seeking behavior) are a direct reflection of the value a business adds to society. how do businesses make a profit? by providing a product or service. consumer demand does affect prices and the ability for a business to charge a high price depends largely on how unique (absent competition) the good or service. they make profit because people give them money, and people give them money because people value that good or service more than they value the money (or the alternative of not getting that good or service). there are many cases where for-profit companies are more effective at addressing a certain problem than non-profits are, the profit factor is irrelevant with regards to the efficacy. if a business wants to make large profits, they need to figure out what they can do to command those profits, and more often than not, they end up with a product or service that enriches the lives of the consumers and ultimately society as a whole. profit can also be an incentive for putting more effort into the development of certain goods. everyone once to find a cure for x, y, z diseases, but if you allow for the profit motive, you get a lot more people putting effort into it. think of the arts too, if there was no profit motive, a lot of people would see art as not being a feasible career, something they could devote all their time to, and less art would be created (you could also argue profit provides an incentive to create higher quality art). i would recommend listening to this podcast, [munger on profits, entrepreneurship, and storytelling](>mike munger of duke university talks with econtalk host russ roberts about profit. what is profit's role in allocating resources? how should we feel about the people who earn profits or who take them in ways that may not be earned? how easy is it to discover profitable opportunities? munger examines these questions through a series of stories, real and fictional, to illuminate the sometimes puzzling nature of profit. mises is eh, but this may be a good read for you too [profit and loss]((a1, a5, b3, b6) >the abhorrent costs and inflation rates for insurance and higher education, there's a lot of reasons for these high prices, profit-seeking surely exists, but i definitely wouldn't say it is the driving factor for education. >the stifling of scientific research and artistic creation into narrow fields for the purpose of making money. do you have some direct examples of this? >when agricultural biotechnologists focus on producing crops resistant to pesticide to sell to large agri-corporations rather than producing higher-yield, healthier crops for third-world farmers who need them so much more. profit motives do not prevent people from doing things unprofitable, it just provides an incentive for different people. it brings more players into the game, so to speak, rather than necessarily shifting the desires of those already in the game. if i was wanting to do something absent a profit motive, adding one wont generally change that. e: reading your other comments, this podcast [munger on love, money, profits, and non-profits](is also worth a listen: >mike munger of duke university talks with econtalk host russ roberts about the world of profit, money, love, gifts, and incentives. what motivates people, self-interest or altruism? both obviously. but how do these forces interact with each other? does relying on one always provide a stronger incentive than the other? do charities, for-profit businesses or government agencies do a better job providing a good or service? munger and roberts have a wide-ranging discussion across these issues including a section where they discuss whether christmas gift-giving and gift-giving in general is inefficient.",cqog780,470.40476767615695,1,1429991547,31,6,-17309,0,47.89338151658768,633.0,1029.0,30.0,11,0.1,0.0,0.2,0.26666666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.03333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6333333333333333,0.06991650864822639,0.2685624012638231,0.0,0,0.0,649,80.78,63.27,10.76,99.00,21.63,23.73,88.91,47.30,8.78,3.54,0.46,0.15,1.08,0.00,1.85,5.24,7.70,13.25,6.93,4.47,7.70,1.39,12.17,5.24,3.70,2.31,0.62,3.54,9.86,9.09,0.77,0.00,0.31,0.15,10.02,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.31,18.03,2.31,5.08,3.24,4.62,1.54,6.01,0.92,0.15,0.62,0.15,0.77,0.00,0.46,0.00,0.00,13.71,0.92,3.54,2.77,6.63,0.77,0.77,9.24,0.77,8.01,0.92,5.70,1.39,11.56,1.23,0.15,8.01,0.15,0.00,0.15,0.00,0.15,0.00,0.00,0.00,17.41,3.24,6.32,0.31,0.00,1.39,0.00,2.00,0.00,0.46,2.00,1.69

t3_3hcpmz,"while disappointing, i cannot say your view is unique here on reddit or anywhere else in the country, so i am glad you are here on cmv. > > as i grew older, my classmates and i were bombarded with racial messages during school and everywhere else. we were taught that white people were somehow inherently racist. we were taught that everyone else was perfect and every bad thing they did throughout history was somehow righteous and justified. i started to see lines forming. white kids were told that they were somehow responsible for everything some people in the past did. black kids were taught that they were owed something. i noticed kids start self-segregating. it was not anything dramatic, no one attributed this to the things we were being taught, but people knew they were different now. > > could you provide examples of this? as someone who is black, i was never taught that i was ""owed"" anything. i was also never taught that all white people are responsible for the hideous injustices of the past. > i grew older still. i started paying attention to the news and the internet,. race was discussed alot. i learned about affirmative action and it made my blood boil. if you didn't know, asians are hurt the most by affirmative action. i would need a much higher sat score and gpa than a black person to get into the schools of my choice. i started to resent black people for this. why was i being hurt because an entire race was apparently performing poorly and my entire race wasn't? while i am not a supporter of aa, it is often a misunderstood policy. pretend you have 2 little league football coaches: coach 1 takes over a team that was 2-12, and at the end of the season has a score of 8-6 coach 2 takes over a team that was 7-7, and at the end of the season that is 10-4 i want to hire the most qualified coach. if i just look at what their current seasons were, i would have to go with coach 2. coach 2 clearly has a superior record to coach 1. however, is coach 2 really more qualified? coach 1 obviously had to begin with a *much* worse team than coach 2. if i honestly want the best coach, it would be foolish not to take that into account. the idea behind aa is that we take into account peoples starting positions. this is where the confusion is. if an average white kid gets a score of 1980 on the sat, and an average black kid gets a score of 1800, the argument is not that the less qualified black person should get the spot. the argument is that the black student ***is*** the more qualified student. the idea is that we can't just look at the test scores in a vacuum, and that if the black student was raised in the same circumstance, they would have scored much higher. the reason to not support aa is not because it hurts the students getting passed over, but because it often hurts the students being let in. even if we concede that a black kid being raised by a single mom working 2 jobs is at a supreme disadvantage, if we let that kid into an advanced school, it still does not change the fact that they do not have the skillset to be able to perform in that environment. being a good student is learned behavior, and it is very unlikely this kid was taught how to be a good student. they simply will not be able to perform, no matter how smart they are, due to their upbringing. > and if discrimination was the reason, well my race was discriminated against in the past too! this was opinion shared by my friends. it led us to think that if this was the case, black people didn't try very much and were lazy in school. otherwise why would they need help? i was infuriated to learn that a black girl who took all level classes and was not even close to the top of the class was accepted into my first choice college while i was not, despite my excellent grades and test scores. when i went to college, i made sure to avoid going to black doctors and other black professionals for fear than they got their position due to unfair preferences. asians certainly delt with discrimination in the us. however, the discrimination faced was far less severe and could not have as large an effect on their population. this is due to most asian americans voluntarily coming here, meaning you have a *very* significant selection factor going on. to put it bluntly, most asians already came here with marketable skills(otherwise they would never have made it here). when you have marketable skills, discrimination is far less effective a means to harm people. here is a good video explaining this: if you no longer want to go to black professionals because of this, that's your business. but i feel the need to remind you that getting into the college does not net you a degree. you still need to pass the classes and graduate, and black students do not get aa while professors are grading their exams. > i learned about the black crime rate, and prison population. i started to become scared when i saw a black person on the streets. you need to be careful with how you interpret statistics. the reason that most people will charge people who cite these statistics racist is because they are usually trying to cite them to present a narrative of the black thug, and do very little to interpret any statistic honestly. here is a related example. imagine you have a small asian town in california that kidnaps people that pass by and cannibalizes them. they do this for an entire year, kidnapping around 50 people. when they are caught, and then convicted of this heinous act, later that year i release a headline: **98% of all cannibalism cases committed by asians**. this would be a true statement statistically. since cannibalism is a very rare crime, this town would responsible for almost 100 percent of the cannibalism cases. however, this is disingenuous to say the least. me presenting the headline in that manner suggests that asians everywhere are to be feared. seeing an asian in vermont might cause people to be cautious that that person would eat them. by printing it i would *knowingly* be spreading misinformation, while technically not telling a single lie. as for the black crime rate, most of it is concentrated in very specific high crime areas. you could look at the murder rate the same way we looked at cannibalism. it is, when dealing with a country of 330 million, a rare crime. in 2013 there were about 14,000 murders total. if half of those were black males, that is *still* only 7000. if we are **generous** and say all those murders were committed by unique individuals, we still have 7000 males out of how many millions? this means that 99.9% of black people you meet have never killed anyone, and will never kill anyone. sure, you could say that for other races it is 99.99, or 99.999, but 0.01 is still an infinitesimal amount of people no matter how you slice it. to top it off the bulk of these murders can again be traced back to about a dozen or so places. most of them dealing with drugs. the idea that black people are just running around killing everyone is a myth. to make it more personal, has any black person ever put their hands on you? assaulted you? murdered someone you know? my guess is no, and it will probably never happen. another common misconception seen on reddit is ""black people kill white people like 10 bajilliion times more than white people kill black people."" technically true, but misleading. let us leave out the fact that gross population differences will screw with these numbers, as this post is long enough as is, and just stick with the same line of reasoning as before. in 2013, the amount of whites murdered by blacks was around 350. not 350,000, not 3500....350. if you are white in this country the chances of a black person killing you is essentially zero percent. you are 10 times more likely to die of food poisoning, and how often are you worried about that? > so basically, i feel like if we brought our kids up to not see color and talk about americans as americans, rather than african-american, asian american, etc, racism would soon become a thing of the past it's odd that you say this, while admitting earlier that you are a racist. racism cannot be solved by simply ignoring it. if you think it can, then indulge me with examples of *any* problem with society that was changed through people ignoring the problem. i would be surprised if you could give me a singe example.",cu6c4si,4660.18090722161,1,1439850525,87,19,6490,0,70.09492712550608,1482.0,2118.0,95.0,4,0.031578947368421054,0.021052631578947368,0.16842105263157894,0.15789473684210525,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010526315789473684,0.0,0.0,0.021052631578947368,0.12631578947368421,0.0,0.5368421052631578,NaN,0.1902834008097166,0.0,0,0.0,1526,47.91,61.86,36.13,10.77,16.96,16.51,88.34,55.31,14.35,7.40,2.88,0.98,1.97,0.00,1.57,6.95,7.01,11.60,10.94,5.96,6.29,2.29,17.96,5.24,3.28,1.18,3.34,2.88,4.39,1.57,2.75,0.33,1.18,0.33,9.83,0.07,0.13,0.13,0.13,15.60,2.82,2.16,3.08,3.74,2.23,4.52,3.74,2.95,0.33,0.46,0.59,0.13,0.20,0.07,0.13,7.86,1.57,1.31,3.41,1.70,0.52,6.03,9.83,0.79,11.73,1.64,5.31,4.72,4.33,1.31,0.07,0.59,0.00,0.85,0.26,0.07,0.13,0.00,0.07,0.00,14.15,5.44,4.46,0.20,0.00,0.59,0.07,0.39,0.26,0.39,0.13,2.23
t3_3fql48,"the idea of a single, normative islam is not a helpful construction to someone on the outside who wishes to treat islam academically. typically, all we require is self-identification as muslim, and then the person defines _his_ islam. we try not to sign off on particular versions as authentic or real, and instead try to present the history, the branches, etc. islamism finds itself on the tree of islam when islam is treated academically, and the idea that we could not somehow trace it back to the roots, that it would clearly be shown to be inauthentic, seems implausible. if it is really to be treated academically, the message will be chaos. i would like to compare it to my first steps into studying christianity academically. i had a single view of christianity in mind and believed that it was essentially straightforward, although there were minor wobbles. catholics killed lots, martin luther saved us, and then america. i reacted in horror when i finally dug into christianity academically. not only were there catholics, but there were orthodox. and people who didn't think jesus was god. and unitarians. and universalists. there were churches in ethiopia and there were monophysites and diopho-whatevers. there were chinese christians who had some pretty weird views. ebionites, which sounded racist. and god knows what relationship god, the jews, and christians are supposed to have. it was chaos. an academic study of a religion rarely reveals a single, pure source. this is true in islam too - few generations after the prophet, the ummah is already split. and today it still is. not just sunni/shia. there are also ahmaddiya/qadiani, who to outsiders are indistinguishible. there are four major schools of fiqh. and maybe this is the isnad for the use of the miswak during fasting, or maybe it is a pile of spaghetti. ... and all of this plays directly into the hands of the islamist. the average person will recoil from all the choice he has just been presented. all the islamist has to do is present his purified, simple version, and he has saved the day. the average person does not want, cannot tolerate, cannot sustain so much complexity. the islamist message is appealing _because_ it gives straightforward, unambiguous answers that do not require three pages of footnotes, even if they are wrong. you want thinkers, but you cannot turn your average person into a ""thinker."" this is not an insult - i have taught hundreds of good people, many of whom nevertheless fail to master any significant level of critical thinking. i know that most people fail not because of capacity, but because their environment does not afford them the sort of leisure they need. they have families. they have jobs. besides, the west coming in to teach the muslim world its faith... the audacity of the idea is breathtaking. even if we were best positioned to do it, we would hardly be the best positioned to do it. the backlash would probably invalidate the entire project. i'm not saying it wouldn't help for the average muslim to know more about his religion. any bit of extra knowledge anywhere would help. but simply because #1) military interventions have not worked and #2) an educated populace would be nice, does not mean this is a workable solution.",ctr20mq,566.8610555020318,1,1438724031,42,12,5237,0,58.439526380681116,547.0,876.0,43.0,1,0.046511627906976744,0.0,0.16279069767441862,0.3953488372093023,0.0,0.0,0.06976744186046512,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09302325581395349,0.023255813953488372,0.7906976744186047,0.01530612244897959,0.2906764168190128,0.0,0,0.0,553,45.06,47.11,19.00,35.23,13.17,23.15,87.70,55.88,10.85,5.06,1.45,1.08,0.54,0.90,1.08,5.79,7.78,10.31,12.30,6.69,7.23,3.25,16.64,4.70,1.63,1.63,1.63,4.16,3.44,1.99,1.45,0.18,0.54,0.36,8.14,0.18,0.00,0.00,0.90,18.63,3.98,1.63,2.89,4.34,1.81,5.79,1.08,0.54,0.36,0.18,0.54,0.36,0.00,0.00,0.18,6.15,2.53,1.81,2.53,0.54,0.54,3.44,11.39,1.08,8.32,0.72,4.52,3.25,2.71,0.36,0.18,0.00,5.79,0.18,0.18,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.18,0.00,17.90,8.50,5.97,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.72,0.36,0.54,0.36,1.45

t3_38ah82,"> its supposed to be a journey where you explore other places and other cultures. okay, so i am not going to get into a ""who said?"" version of this debate because that's pointless. i will accept your premise. so what you would argue is that my trip to costa rica is inherently more valuable than my trip to, say dublin because i live in the united states. fair enough. but here is my counterpoint: i am quasi-humiliated by my trip to costa rica because that shit was fucked up. traveling to non-western (re: poor) countries is an incredibly morally murky process. it does not *have* to be but if you do not speak the language (one of your points) you are stuck with using industries that thrive off of western travelers. and those industries can have a devastating effect on those areas. now,we all can get behind the idea that going to thailand to engage in sex trade is a pretty reprehensible. that's clear cut. but what about that beach resort in mexico? who's running it? who profits? whose working at it? under what condition? what local industries/buildings/landmarks got bulldozed in order to capitalize on the beach front? costa rica is absolutely beautiful. but the culture is, with few exceptions, to be folksy for tourists. that's what people do. much like parents who will amputate a limb of a child so they do better begging, this has some pretty serious consequences. no one is building anything. all the major infrastructure (the resorts, the tour packages, the skyride tours) was built by western cultures. what is left for locals is to essentially pander to the tourists. and they *do*. and it is kind of sad. yes, we spend money. i bought bracelets and sodas and magazines and candy. and that, i am sure, has a positive impact. but the net impact, the larger picture, is that the travel industry is pretty much holding people hostage because the money pouring in pours right back out to the people who invested in the infrastructure and only the dregs trickle down. we visited a very rural school and it was so striking because it was one of the only places we visited where we weren't being pandered to. **so here is my point**: exploring other places and cultures is an inherently imperialist act. for more info, i strongly recommend reading *a small place* by jamaica kincaid. the idea you are espousing might actually be more imperialist, more harmful. at the end of the day i think there is value in experiencing other cultures and people, but i also know that my gain comes at a price for their culture. it has to. but we do not talk about that. we focus on the small gains made by locals who profit off the travel money. we do not think about the bigger picture of who profits from travel and what is lost in creating that infrastructure. yes, if you go to rural laos this is less of a problem, but who the fuck wants to vacation there. even if you did, how are you going to get around if you do not speak the language or have any help. that's simply not realistic for most people. but western tourism (visiting new york for example) does not come with the same moral quandaries. we are capitalizing off our own tourism. we are capitalizing off our own tourism in [thailand](as well, but we do so by swooping in and taking over. the whole ""value"" of experiencing other cultures? we are the ones that made that up. probably to sell hotel rooms. in costa rica.",crtkrsw,225.59405764500121,1,1433291578,47,16,1493,0,70.3306924217463,607.0,891.0,50.0,31,0.02,0.0,0.2,0.22,0.0,0.0,0.02,0.0,0.0,0.02,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48000000000000004,0.033187560738581146,0.2471169686985173,0.0,0,0.0,612,53.02,69.96,55.93,46.88,12.24,18.46,86.11,56.37,15.36,7.03,2.45,2.29,1.80,0.00,0.49,8.33,6.86,13.07,10.46,4.90,7.03,1.63,17.65,4.08,2.12,3.10,0.49,2.29,5.39,3.27,2.12,0.16,0.82,0.49,11.11,0.16,0.00,0.00,0.00,12.09,1.63,1.96,1.14,2.61,0.98,5.39,1.63,0.65,0.65,0.00,1.31,0.16,0.33,0.49,0.33,7.84,2.61,0.98,2.61,1.96,0.33,2.94,12.42,1.14,13.56,3.43,9.31,0.82,1.80,1.80,0.16,2.29,0.16,0.00,1.31,0.49,0.00,0.65,0.16,0.00,17.81,6.86,3.27,0.49,0.00,1.31,0.00,0.33,0.65,0.98,1.47,2.45

t3_306b19,">1) people think we caused (or impacted at all) the changes the reason that people think we are causing the climate to change is because of simple physics. the problem is ultimately about conservation of energy, that is, the total energy incident on the earth from the sun has to be accounted for completely. this is called ""radiative balancing"". [here](is a nice cartoon representation. physics tells us that different components of the atmosphere interact with radiation, that is, heat and light, differently. ""heat"" is mostly associated with infrared radiation, which is strongly absorbed by gases in the atmosphere. [here](is a plot which shows how much radiation is transmitted and absorbed over the relevant wavelength range. the upshot is this - co2 ""traps"" heat. if you increase the amount of co2 in the atmosphere, you will warm the surface. humans have emitted a very large amount of co2. we can look at this on a global scale. [here](is a map of the measured longwave radiation (""heat"") and [here](is the global co2 concentration as measured by an orbiting nasa observatory. note that where co2 concentration is high is where the measured heat flux is low. this is one of many things you expect if climate change is driven by co2 emissions. >2) why people think these changes are catastrophic to our way of life most people do not think that the average redditor will be catastrophically impacted. what most people, including economists and policy makers have recognized is that climate change will impact our ability to grow and distribute food, it will lead to migration away from coastlines, and associated infrastructure costs. for the average redditor in the us or europe, your lunch might be a bit more expensive than it otherwise would be. it hurts the economy on a macro-scale, but it will not be catastrophic. where it will really hurt is in places like asia and africa, where economies are less developed and people have less capital to be able to afford more expensive food and energy.",cppjkxe,205.01520106693806,1,1427236690,62,9,-22424,0,52.973805546801174,334.0,537.0,19.0,1,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.10526315789473684,0.5789473684210527,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.10526315789473684,0.0,0.0,0.8947368421052632,0.07453055296192551,0.3023952095808383,0.0,0,0.0,341,72.05,70.13,15.68,36.05,17.95,21.99,80.35,51.91,9.38,3.23,0.00,2.05,1.17,0.00,0.00,6.16,8.50,11.73,12.61,4.69,5.28,0.59,14.66,4.99,2.93,2.64,0.88,4.40,2.93,1.76,1.17,0.00,0.00,0.88,6.16,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,12.32,2.35,3.81,1.47,2.35,0.88,3.52,1.76,0.88,0.00,0.88,1.17,0.00,0.29,0.00,0.88,5.57,2.35,1.17,2.05,0.00,0.29,0.29,12.32,2.35,10.56,2.64,7.33,0.59,2.93,0.88,0.00,2.05,0.00,0.00,0.59,0.00,0.59,0.00,0.00,0.00,18.18,5.57,3.81,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.59,2.35,0.00,2.93,2.93

t3_39r5ej,"there are several issues with your cmv. 1) mental health medications is an incredibly broad topic that includes an incredibly broad range of substances with a wide variance of research backing their effectiveness and safety for a very broad range of conditions and purposes. it is next to impossible to have a single discussion on antipsychotics, anti-depressants, anti-obsessive agents, anti-anxiety agents, maois, mood stabalizers, cns stimulants, anti-panic agents, and so on. there are often dozens of drugs available within each category. the number of drugs that fall under that umbrella is significant: the difference in treatment risk analysis between someone who is self-reporting mild depression and who wants drugs rather than a change of diet and exercise, and someone who needs to be on multiple neuroleptics because of severe schizophrenia is a pretty wide gulf. 2) the controls around prescribing medications are fairly uniform as to the degree of training required by the person doing the prescribing. while there are issues with, for example, gp md's prescribing psychotropics without having significant experience doing so, this is really no different from gp md's prescribing any other medication that is more appropriately prescribed by a specialist. so drugs covering mental health treatment are not different in this regard. 3) that you have not found any information on, for example, how neurotransmitters impact different parts of the brain, does not mean that information is not present. the discussion about subjective experience is really a broader issue covered under the ""mind-body"" problem. but from a purely biological perspective, we do not need to be able to solve that issue to know that certain symptoms are treatable by addressing particular neurotransmitter problems. moreover, for some mental health conditions, the activity and experience are very well understood. for example, we know that bradykinesia is effectively treated by levodopa because the cause of the symptom is precisely dopamine levels. so, while we do not know the cause of the dopamine level issue in great detail, we do not need to in order to treat the symptom. which is no different from, say, using nitro tablets to treat idiopathic angina. we have a symptom that is made manageable by the use of a substance, so we use that substance to manage the symptom. 4) monitoring is not an issue with knowledge about the drug. monitoring is an issue with patient compliance and health insurance coverages. 6) there are issues around over-prescribing, fda hacking by drug companies, drug marketing, off-label use, and a host of other related points. however, these are not unique to drugs used in treating mental health. ergo, you can't really say those issues uniquely make drugs related to mental health a special case.",cs5wyjs,799.4939510888443,1,1434261170,40,11,20456,0,40.85854778028596,443.0,757.0,21.0,19,0.047619047619047616,0.0,0.14285714285714285,0.5238095238095238,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14285714285714285,0.047619047619047616,0.14285714285714285,0.14285714285714285,0.0,1.1904761904761905,0.07731837606837606,0.27539503386004516,0.0,0,0.0,456,85.12,44.78,13.83,22.37,21.71,26.54,79.39,47.37,7.46,2.19,0.00,1.32,0.66,0.00,0.22,5.26,7.46,14.69,7.89,5.04,4.82,2.85,12.28,5.92,2.41,1.10,1.54,1.75,3.95,1.75,1.97,0.88,0.00,0.44,5.04,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,16.89,3.73,4.39,1.75,1.75,0.66,5.48,1.32,0.00,0.44,0.00,7.68,0.44,7.02,0.00,0.22,4.82,1.32,0.66,1.75,0.22,0.88,0.88,11.18,0.22,7.02,0.44,5.26,1.10,2.63,0.22,0.00,0.44,0.00,0.00,0.22,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.22,0.00,15.35,4.61,6.58,0.22,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.75,0.44,0.66,1.10,0.00
t3_39sihw,"so i live in the us for the most part, though i also spend a lot of time in canada. in the us, the first amendment to the constitution has been interpreted very strictly as making the sorts of bans you are talking about impossible. canada does have such bans though. having lived in both countries, and being in a couple of minority groups which have been historically persecuted (homosexuals and jews) i tend to find the american approach better. first, there is the problem of knowing where the line is. for the us, i can be very certain that almost anything i could possibly say is constitutionally protected speech, and i do not have to fear criminal prosecution. i personally doubt that i would say much that could be prosecuted under hate speech laws, but i do discuss issues around race occasionally in public forums like this one. and it comforts me to know that under us law, i do not have to worry. as long as i am not threatening a specific person with a plausible threat of violence, i am in the legal clear. on the other hand, canadian hate speech laws have been used as a threat, even when not carried out, that can suppress speech. for instance, the harper government [recently threatened hate speech prosecutions](of leaders in the boycott, divestment, and sanctions (bds) movement against the israeli government. would such prosecutions hold up in canadian court? likely not. but they are not laughably implausible, and can subject those charged to arrest, enormous legal costs, and immense stress as they fight the charges. the fact of the laws existing has a chilling effect on speech, since people will be afraid an unfriendly government can use it against them. further, bans on hate speech give political ammunition to racists and other such people. freedom of speech is a core right in a liberal democracy, and advocating against government censorship a time honored tradition. by using the incredible coercive power of the state against certain disliked speech, you are putting the racists in the position of having a really important value to defend. lastly, there is an alternate solution to getting what you want - put in constitutional-level protections against discriminatory laws. people can advocate for discriminatory laws all they want, but they can't get them because they are unconstitutional. and if they can achieve the sort of supermajority necessary for constitutional amendment to get the policy through anyway, it is not likely that any hate speech law would have stopped them advocating it.",cs63or0,922.6912618857743,1,1434288045,26,5,9741,0,51.33145098039219,425.0,678.0,21.0,141,0.2857142857142857,0.0,0.19047619047619047,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047619047619047616,0.047619047619047616,0.047619047619047616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9523809523809526,0.06431727994227995,0.2823529411764706,0.0,0,0.0,427,76.17,43.48,31.05,2.67,20.33,23.89,86.18,53.63,10.77,6.79,3.04,0.94,0.70,0.00,2.11,3.98,8.43,14.52,10.54,4.45,5.85,1.87,16.39,3.75,2.34,0.94,0.70,2.11,6.79,2.11,4.68,2.11,2.34,0.00,6.79,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,14.52,1.41,1.87,2.34,3.04,1.64,5.15,3.51,0.23,3.04,0.23,0.94,0.23,0.47,0.23,0.00,11.24,1.41,1.64,6.32,1.41,2.58,1.87,12.41,0.23,10.77,1.17,6.79,2.81,3.98,0.23,0.00,0.47,0.23,0.00,0.23,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.23,13.11,4.68,5.85,0.00,0.00,0.23,0.00,0.47,0.00,0.23,1.17,0.47

t3_301n6h,"to be frank, i can't change your views on ""acceptable,"" because i can't force you or anyone else to give a shit about natives. i do not have the conversational skills to inspire empathy. but it is definitely racially insensitive. the main reason people are getting pissed about this: native (and all non-white) actors have a tougher time getting parts in mainstream films and movies. characters are white by default. white is relatable, white is the majority, make a character white and they are a blank slate for you to write about. minority characters are 1) stereotyped by default, 2) harder for the majority white audience to relate to. there is less parts available for non-white actors, in general, and there is less stories being told about explicitly non-white characters because that's what sells.^1 in *unbreakable*, there is an explicitly native part, an explicitly native part in a relatively mainstream television show (even if it is a netflix exclusive), and it's... given to a white actress instead. that's why people are upset about it, it is like dangling a perfect steak in front of someone who has not eaten in a day and then snatching it away. point by point: **1**. yeah, i do not think those writers are actually native, as in, having a tribe membership. here is the quote again from carlock: > we actually have a couple of writers on staff with native american heritage. there's a **huge** difference between native and ""with native american heritage."" you pick out half of your modern americans, and they are going to claim that their great-grandmother was a cherokee princess. ""native american heritage"" means nothing. what matters is if you are involved with your tribe and if you are part of the community. this varies tribe to tribe, but for a lot of indians^2 community involvement matters way more than blood quantum (though blood quantum still matters, again, depending on the tribe.) spending a year on a rez is better than nothing, but it could easily have been for one of those feel-good mission trips. the phrasing makes it seem dubious to me on whether or not that person actually has a tribal membership. but anyway, even if they are part of a tribe, there is at least one native who's annoyed by the casting choice and [has written about it](it is not like one native person (who wants to keep their job) on staff suddenly makes everything okay by all indians everywhere. **2.** yeah, it being a business decision motivated by no ill intent does not suddenly guarantee that it is racially sensitive, like op is claiming. it just means that the show's creators do not actively despise natives, which is not exactly a high bar. > there are no such native american actors to fill these specific needs at the moment. that itself is bullshit, but it is not this show's fault. but the show is perpetuating this problem. with its current writing, it is the perfect opportunity for a native actress to get her break and end up a big star. and they decided not to go with that, because, hey, more money. people are upset because of the missed opportunity. the show is contributing to the problem, regardless of intent. **2b.** yeah, it is cool that they hired two actual indians for her parents. 2/3 is better than zero, even if it is still a failing grade. **3.** yay for it not being actively disrespectful for the traditions. the writing is not as horrid as most writing handling indians is in this respect, though to be honest i do not think it handles the core issue of jacqueline that well. lots of modern day natives really struggle with whether or not to assimilate to white/american culture to get ahead, or to stay with their roots and work in their communities?depending on where you are, this affects whether or not you go to college, whether or not you move off the rez into a city where you can actually make some money, whether you learn your tribe's language?it's a huge struggle for modern day indians, a lot of the time, trying to find where they fit with their culture, within mainstream culture. jacqueline's main struggle is actually a big one, and a common one, and the show does not handle it well at all.^3 it does not totally fuck it up, but the deftness with which fey handles the other serious themes?a guy being treated like shit because he has black, a twink actor trying and failing to get straight parts when he has so glaringly gay, a woman recovering from a decade long abusive hellhole by switching cities and restarting her life, a woman confronting her ex-abuser in a kangaroo court that is not going to believe her?that clever self awareness and biting humor is just not there when it comes to jacqueline's struggle over her heritage and her desire to succeed (by western, american standards). there is no deeper understanding of the issue, no biting one-liners that cut to the heart of the struggle like there is for the other character. there is just jenna maroney... ignoring a traffic sign and using the sun to navigate, like her father taught her. it is total bull and it rings really hollow next to the superb writing everywhere else. ______ [1] i can try and find data proving that there is less non-white roles, if you want, but imo this is common sense and pretty self evident so i am not going to bother unless somebody calls me out on it. [2] ""native american"" is the pc term in the same way that ""homosexual"" is the pc term for a gay person. you are not going to hear a gay person identify as ""a homosexual"" and you are not going to hear a native person say ""native american,"" at least most of the time.
