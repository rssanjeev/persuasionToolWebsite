t3_2y1ryu,"an issue i see with partisanship is that they cause sheepish people (a huge fraction of all people) to mindlessly agree with every position their side tells them to. for example, does not it seem weird that of the two parties we have, one of them wants to let you do whatever you want with your money, but tell you what to do with your body/sexlife, whereas the other party wants to tell you what to do with your money, but do whatever you want with your body/sexlife? i live in a super liberal area and, because i am not partisan and think for myself on each specific issue, i get labeled conservative even though i vote left on ~70% of the issues. was having a discussion at work about abortion, everyone there is basically a sjw/gluten free/white men are raping the world/etc type. my position was that i thought 20 weeks was too late for non medical reasons and thought it should be reduced. however, i also said that they should remove all barriers to having one such as mandatory counseling that tries to convince the women they are evil murderers and that it should be a no questions asked thing covered by the state. compromise for both sides? nope, i am a woman hating hitler. in contrast, if i was in a room full of right wing people in a different part of the country and said that the government should stop telling us to do with our money, i would get agreed with. if i immediately then said they should not tell people who to marry either, those cheers would instantly turn to boos. *tldr: the problem with partisanship is that most people are not smart enough to avoid being sheeple and will simply agree with whatever their side tells them to. their inability to resist being tribal causes an unproductive, us vs them mentality.*",cp5fifc,141.10176737273792,0,1425582658,14,0,1368,0,59.6319831223629,316.0,450.0,12.0,0,0.08333333333333333,0.0,0.4166666666666667,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08333333333333333,0.0,0.08333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.08333333333333333,0.0,1.0,0.01919191919191919,0.26582278481012656,0.0,0,0.0,323,53.73,80.69,17.87,36.68,26.92,15.79,88.85,57.28,17.96,11.46,4.02,1.24,2.79,0.00,3.41,6.50,5.88,13.93,10.53,3.41,5.26,1.86,18.58,4.33,1.24,1.86,1.55,2.48,4.95,2.79,2.17,0.31,0.93,0.00,15.17,0.31,0.00,0.62,0.31,13.31,2.17,1.24,4.33,1.55,1.55,4.64,1.55,0.62,0.93,0.00,1.86,0.62,0.93,0.62,0.00,6.50,2.79,1.24,0.93,0.62,1.24,2.79,10.84,1.24,8.98,0.62,6.50,1.86,1.24,0.62,0.31,1.24,0.00,0.31,0.93,0.00,0.31,0.62,0.00,0.00,11.76,3.10,4.33,0.31,0.00,0.62,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.62,2.79

t3_3ddcu5,"i feel like the ridiculous commonality of guns, both legal and illegal, is one of the biggest reasons american police have too much power. --- 1) there are far too many guns in america, and it is far too easy for criminals to get access to them. handguns, in particular, are extremely cheap, both legal ones and illegal ones - many of them can be bought with a day or two of flipping hamburgers in mcdonalds. --- 2) because there are too many guns, we have created laws enabling police to defend themselves from *any* perceived threat with lethal force - if someone is reaching for a pocket, or a waistband, or does anything strange at all, police are taught to assume its a gun and have permission to respond with the same, since their own safety is paramount. this would not be the case if it weren't so damn easy for criminals to get guns, and if it weren't so damn common for people to pull these guns on cops. note: this situation is one of those things that escalates and makes itself worse. one criminal pulls a weapon on a cop, cops in the entire district become more paranoid, more likely to pull their gun out on every little thing. the people these cops interact with become more scared of the police, and are more likely to look for guns to defend themselves with from these trigger-happy cops, creating even *more* trigger-happy cops as more criminals appear with guns. --- 3) other nations without such free access to guns have their criminal element far less well-armed. i remember a german law enforcement officer posting on reddit saying that he himself never carried a gun, and that he only saw a gun maybe once per 2-3 years of 10 years working in a big german city. --- 4) finally, i would also want to point out that america has some of the strongest police oversight in the world, which means that when cops act badly or fuck something up, they get caught, much more easily. since american cops tend to fuck up with guns more often, due to the disparate gun culture of the country, their fuckups tend to be a lot more visible, with much greater consequence. --- **tl;dr** i would suggest that the current excessive problems of police in america is rooted in its fucked up gun culture and extremely cheap and easy access to guns. most people who own guns are not crazy or criminal, but when they are, the people who have to deal with them are the police, who are forced to escalate their use of guns in response to the guns owned by their opponents. when the police make a mistake (and they will eventually, everybody does), the results are way more tragic. these problems do not exist in countries where guns are more heavily regulated, are less common, and are way harder for criminals and crazy people to obtain.",ct43043,1306.1778910342498,0,1436968783,269,35,-20008,0,52.55232438016532,484.0,707.0,16.0,1,0.0625,0.0,0.0625,0.3125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0625,0.5625,0.10388722388722388,0.22520661157024793,0.0,0,0.0,495,77.11,52.42,16.48,7.25,30.94,16.97,86.06,49.49,10.51,4.44,0.81,0.20,0.00,0.61,2.83,6.06,5.86,14.95,8.08,4.85,6.06,1.41,14.34,7.88,4.65,1.62,2.42,5.66,6.87,2.63,4.24,0.61,1.62,0.20,6.87,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.61,13.54,1.62,3.64,2.02,4.24,1.41,3.23,1.62,0.81,0.20,0.40,1.01,0.20,0.20,0.61,0.00,12.53,0.40,1.01,8.48,1.41,1.62,2.02,10.51,0.40,12.12,1.01,7.68,3.03,3.03,0.20,0.00,0.81,0.00,0.20,1.41,1.01,0.20,0.00,0.20,0.00,17.37,3.23,6.26,0.20,0.20,0.00,0.00,4.24,0.00,0.40,1.21,1.62

t3_3b6tst,"other than the issues mentioned above, this may cause serious social problems for the women in question. although this is not the universal situation, many women may be pressured by family to wear the burqa when outside. not doing so could put the woman in danger of retaliation by her community or family... and as a result, women in this situation may be put under a ""house arrest"" of sorts from fear of going outside and being attacked. these women would likely be unable to leave the country since, again, they could not go outside and other countries may not consider them eligible. it would be illegal for her to cover herself outside, but following this law could lead to such atrocities as ""honor"" killings or domestic assaults. even if this only happens to a small population, i believe such a ruling would still be unconstitutional as it would put these women in danger. and as for identity, the burqa contributes to the identity of women who enjoy it. to ask them to not wear the burqa can be compared to asking a western female to strip to her undergarments. although the burqa can be seen as excessive in western culture, this is considered normal dress for women who use it, and asking for removal would make these women incredibly uncomfortable. anyways, thank you so much for asking this! you took a big leap in making this post, and your openness is very commendable.",csjslig,108.85939864117313,0,1435353261,329,38,357,0,54.09584699453555,244.0,381.0,12.0,0,0.08333333333333333,0.08333333333333333,0.25,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.08333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.0659090909090909,0.26229508196721313,0.0,0,0.0,244,68.03,74.41,16.53,4.72,20.33,20.08,89.34,59.02,12.30,4.51,0.41,0.00,1.23,1.64,1.23,7.79,6.56,17.62,11.07,4.51,8.20,2.05,19.26,4.92,2.87,1.23,0.00,0.82,6.15,2.05,4.10,1.23,1.23,0.00,13.52,0.82,0.00,5.74,0.00,15.98,1.64,2.87,4.10,3.69,0.00,5.74,0.41,0.41,0.00,0.00,0.82,0.82,0.00,0.00,0.00,7.79,1.64,1.23,4.10,0.41,1.23,0.82,9.43,2.05,13.11,3.69,7.38,1.64,0.82,0.82,1.64,0.00,0.00,0.41,0.41,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.41,12.30,5.33,4.92,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.41,0.00,1.64,0.00,0.00,0.00

t3_2wwm6s,"considering that we cannot see 500 years into the future, i will do my best to change your view regardless. 1. meteor impacts are incredibly unlikely. the earth is at least 5 billion years old, and to have a meteor large enough to cause that sort of damage hit only 6 times makes it incredibly rare. you are also assuming that a we will do nothing about a meteor heading towards us. i am willing to bet that that all the worlds nuclear arsenals could destroy a planet hurtling towards us. it will make short work of a meteor. it is also in the best interests of people to not die, so billions of innovators will come up with ways to get rid of the meteor if the nuke thing does not work. 2. diseases have always been at the forefront of human history. always. it is the factor we could never control, and struck with devastating effect. but when was the last epidemic of a flu that killed millions of people i ask? 1920ish? medicine has come a long way. diseases have been eradicated. treatments are getting better. health standards are increasing. and a smarter population leads to smarter choices when it comes to health and hygiene. for example, we know not to eat dried fruit bats off the floor, because that gives you ebola. and we know not to have sex with people with aids. and we know not to sit behind an x-ray all day. things like that. 3. speaking of nukes, nuking someone is not really viable unless it is a particularly extreme act of terrorism. war is not (no longer anyway) profitable, and is very problematic for a lot of big super powers. say for example russia nuke america, destroying it completely. what would be the point? all trade will cease with america, causing huge problems for russia economy. all of america's allies will retaliate against russia, causing more problems along the way. even russias ally's will suffer, because they traded with the us as well. nuclear war is not viable. it is stupid to even consider it. everyone knows that trade is king. nobody wants to stop trade. trade has propelled civilizations to power, sprung entire religions into being, and made and broken empires for thousands of years. that is not about to change. 4. famine and lack of fresh water and over population are complicated problems, but i will try to explain. we will never run out of food. it is just a fact. even if every farm on the planet was run out of business we will find a way to grow food because we need to. consider this, real modern farms yield a 200% increase with just 1% of the water used compared to traditional farms. if we evenly distributed food across the entire world (taking out spoiling and transportation of course) we can feed people a steady 2,400 calories a day (last i read). this includes people in countries with little agriculture infrastructure. 2,400 is a very good amount. now imagine we double up tradition farms with the hyper efficient modern farms. 2,400 + 200%? that's an insane 7,200 calories per person. and modern farms take up a tiny fraction of the land space as farms, and you can technically have skyscrapers dedicated to farming, meaning the calories can shoot up potentially infinitely. i believe they already have farming skyscrapers in japan, so it is totally a thing! this is all without delving into the infinite possibilities of harvesting insects for calories. 4. yes, we are running out of fresh water. but you are also forgetting we have machines that can purify water. again, 500 years is a lot of time to refine a method to get it done more efficiently and on a bigger scale. but as the same with food, if we need water, we will get water. not to mention aquifers that have not yet been tapped. (i believe there was one discovered in sub saharan africa within the last few years. it is huge man) 4. and over population, is not a big deal. the earth is big. people do not seem to realize how big it is. you can fit the entire human population of earth, shoulder to shoulder inside down town san francisco. we are fine. nobody is worrying about it because more people equals more innovators. more tax payers. more consumers and producers. if there is a need for more housing, we will deal with it somehow. it is the least of our worries really. 5. ice ages and hot periods are a funny one... hot periods are clearly our doing this time around. but the atmosphere will level out as we become more green in the next 100 years or so. we have done damage that can't be repaired sure, but it will not be a death sentence. and maybe life will find other opportunities in the new warmer climate, you never know. we may even become carbon positive as a species, and accidentally create a global cooling crisis. 500 years is a long time. and that's the point here, 500 years is a really long time. it is more than enough time to solve all of our problems we have today. in fact, it wouldn't surprise me to know that people 500 years from now will laugh at our puny problems and then whimper at the huge complicated problems they have that we can't even comprehend. think about it, if the earths population increases as much as it has, we will have more innovators, more young people to invent solutions to our problems. i have no worry about the future. we are now aware of the problems we are causing to our planet. we will sort it out.",covi6v6,200.36677452960703,0,1424785046,51,18,63104,0,72.24727517447661,944.0,1376.0,85.0,0,0.058823529411764705,0.0,0.09411764705882353,0.07058823529411765,0.0,0.011764705882352941,0.0,0.011764705882352941,0.0,0.023529411764705882,0.0,0.011764705882352941,0.023529411764705882,0.0,0.3058823529411765,0.05359590806019378,0.2468220338983051,0.0,0,0.0,971,63.54,64.47,43.24,18.20,11.42,16.99,85.68,52.21,11.23,5.77,1.03,3.71,0.72,0.00,0.31,5.46,6.59,13.39,10.81,4.94,5.87,2.78,16.17,6.80,3.40,0.41,3.60,3.09,4.53,1.96,2.47,0.41,0.62,0.31,7.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.21,15.04,3.19,2.37,2.57,2.27,2.57,3.91,1.34,0.31,0.31,0.62,2.57,0.21,0.93,0.21,1.34,10.92,4.02,1.54,3.09,1.54,1.44,1.13,12.98,2.57,14.42,1.54,7.52,5.36,1.75,0.10,0.10,1.24,0.10,0.62,0.31,0.00,0.00,0.10,0.10,0.10,14.93,8.44,3.91,0.00,0.00,0.41,0.10,0.10,0.00,0.72,0.82,0.41

t3_3f0uzz,"assuming that you define a harmful impact as some effect which is detrimental to us as members of society, amazon echo does not harm as much as it helps us become more productive citizens. what you presented as laziness can be easily reattributed to better time management. instead of jotting items for groceries, which forces one to take out some medium (paper, smartphone, etc), one can more intuitively speak what they want. echo allows one to maintain focus on other more demanding tasks, whereas manual notes requires one to halt other tasks to write down two words. regardless, that device is simply a less distracting medium in which to take notes. echo's ability to provide other standard information is superior to more traditional methods, such as television or newspaper, because of the personalized attributes it has. instead of wading through an hour of breaking news or extraneous advertisements, one more efficiently directly consumes the information they inquire. while i concede that some people will use echo for pure laziness, i do believe that it has the potential to save time if used properly. combined with the busier lifestyle of most households (with both parents at day jobs and the child at school, often having to attend to his or herself), echo does help optimize the free time the family does have. the dependence of technology, specifically electronic assistants like echo, is not necessarily harmful per se. when you state that it creates introverts of people, you forget that many have no need for conversation in person. some do not see the need to be social because they can present the meaning of their messages through technology. some see the task of talking in person as one which costs valuable time speaking about frivolous matters before speaking for a fraction of the time about the actual subject matter. the examples you supplied in technology dependence are more attributable to what you deem laziness, which i have already discussed beforehand. besides, technology is already an integral part to daily life in society. by your logic, one could also argue that cars are entirely unnecessary because humans already have bicycles and their feet to move. however, most people (at least in the usa) need cars to get to their job at a reasonable speed. as for the invasion of privacy, people need to realize that their information is already being ""sold"". businesses want to collect all kinds of data so they can better optimize what they sell to better fit the wants and needs of the consumer. they want to make money after all, and the primary method for doing so is to sell to people. financial advisors will know a detailed record of your stock portfolio, steam will always know what kind of video games you like to play on pc, and your doctor will know all the ailments you have had in the past. instead of hiding this easily obtained personal information, why not embrace it with a larger company which has at least some reputation to maintain? although i personally do not like sharing my information at a whim, i understand that it is sometimes wise to surrender sometimes so that i may increase standards of living. invasion of privacy may be bad, but to what degree? while i concede that echo can be slightly harmful in certain aspects, i argue that its benefit far outweighs the losses incurred. for this reason, echo is not a significantly harmful technology, but rather a beneficial one.",ctka08j,1520.4468709641505,0,1438183889,217,39,5528,0,47.28585353003163,584.0,944.0,26.0,3,0.07692307692307693,0.038461538461538464,0.38461538461538464,0.07692307692307693,0.0,0.0,0.07692307692307693,0.07692307692307693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07692307692307693,0.038461538461538464,0.8461538461538459,0.03749579831932773,0.2842465753424658,0.0,0,0.0,582,80.24,72.61,16.35,58.27,22.38,25.77,82.99,48.45,12.03,5.84,1.55,0.34,1.89,0.34,1.72,6.19,5.67,15.64,7.73,3.61,5.50,1.03,13.92,6.01,4.64,2.41,1.55,4.30,5.15,3.26,1.55,0.00,0.34,0.17,10.14,0.34,0.00,0.17,0.17,16.15,3.78,2.75,2.41,3.44,1.72,3.78,1.03,0.52,0.52,0.00,0.86,0.17,0.52,0.00,0.17,7.04,2.23,1.55,2.41,1.37,0.52,1.55,11.86,1.37,8.76,0.52,4.12,4.12,3.61,1.03,0.34,1.72,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,11.17,4.12,5.15,0.00,0.00,0.34,0.00,0.00,0.34,0.17,1.03,0.00

t3_3a7ys8,"rather than criticize other people's gender identities, you should be thankful that for you it is so cut-and-dry. for some people, it is incredibly complicated, and the reason we have so many terms for similar-sounding things is that they all have subtle nuances, and do not even always mean the same thing - what matters is that the person using them feels that it describes them in a satisfactory way. transgender persons are a small minority, so it is expected that most people will find them to be an odd subversion of the way they expect gender to work. is it so bad to have to exert a minimum of effort in changing your way of thinking so as to include these alternative individuals in society, thereby reducing what can be a seriously harmful amount of pressure and anxiety from living in a world that caters to people who are not like you? even if it is a small minority? it's easy to think these people are just trying to get attention when you are not one of them, but maybe it is because they want everyone else in the world to understand what it is like to be different and have to suffer for it. i am a proponent of listening to what people have to say about themselves and their lives, even if it does not immediately fit into the way i have always viewed the world, rather than expecting everyone to live by the rules i have crafted for myself, and then getting annoyed when people (usually unknowingly) refuse to fall in line. and the way a person defines their own identity - which includes their perception of their gender, as much as their sexual orientation - is one of the foundations that makes a person who they are. you would be understandably annoyed if aliens came to earth to live with us, and insisted that we begin referring to ourselves as *earth* men and *earth* women, to differentiate between martian men and martian women - because it is a pain in the ass, right? but is not it just a basic courtesy, and the cost for integrating these martians into our society, who may have truly fascinating new perspectives to share with us? because i think that's really what it boils down to. do you feel that transgender persons are an interesting alternative to the status quo, or an insufferable nuisance for pushing you outside of your comfort zone? your answer to that question stands to reveal a lot about you.",csacvnt,326.2546447771006,0,1434603412,50,0,17810,0,48.370791156586904,421.0,625.0,13.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.3076923076923077,0.3076923076923077,0.0,0.0,0.07692307692307693,0.0,0.07692307692307693,0.0,0.07692307692307693,0.0,0.07692307692307693,0.0,0.9230769230769229,0.05142973856209151,0.23040380047505937,0.0,0,0.0,424,50.62,85.04,26.42,13.09,32.62,18.87,91.27,61.08,18.40,8.49,1.18,1.42,2.59,0.00,3.30,9.91,6.60,15.57,9.91,5.19,7.78,1.18,16.04,4.95,2.83,2.59,0.47,1.65,4.25,1.65,2.59,0.47,0.71,0.24,14.15,0.00,0.00,0.47,0.47,15.80,4.25,1.65,2.83,3.07,1.42,5.19,2.12,0.24,0.71,0.94,1.89,0.24,1.18,0.24,0.00,4.72,1.65,0.71,1.65,0.47,0.24,0.47,14.15,1.42,9.43,0.94,6.37,2.12,0.71,0.00,0.00,0.24,0.00,0.00,0.24,0.24,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,10.85,1.89,4.01,0.00,0.00,1.18,0.00,1.65,0.00,0.71,0.47,0.94

t3_39sviv,"in large numbers, i agree with you. the spear is fantastic due to it is cost and easy usage in formation fighting. however, at a one on one level, it has a fatal weakness. while the reach can be an advantage, if you get inside of it is ideal range it suddenly becomes unwieldy and a horrible weapon. if you are the person fighting a spear, all you have to do is get past the spearhead, and you have won. often, spearmen would carry another weapon for use when people got into short range. if i were to go into a gladiatorial match against a spearman with my choice of weapon, i would rest easy. with the right techniques, a longsword can make short work of a spear, but i would choose a sword and shield setup (possibly dirk and targe). by catching the spear thrust on the shield, i would easily be able to step inside of his range and cut him open. also, in almost every way that the spear is good, other pole arms are better: >its reach is longer than any non pole arm weapon. the spear is one of the shortest polearms though. if you want reach, go for a pike. >its strikes can create enough power to penetrate most armor. while a good spear can be strong enough to go through armor, a good pike is better. also, pole axes, war-hammers, and other similar weapons are far better at penetrating armor. >it can be turned into a projectile. a spear that is good at line fighting or the melee would be poorly balanced for throwing and would have poor range and penetration (specially designed javelins were carried for this purpose). >its light and fast while other pole arms are heavier, it is still heavier than many non-pole arms. in particular, in a matchup between a spear and a almost any sword, the spear is the slow and heavy one. >its great against cavalry. it is decent against cavalry, but nothing compared to the pike, bill, or halberd.",cs6loyw,806.4463259001592,0,1434327189,393,78,36349,0,72.85258503401364,343.0,476.0,21.0,40,0.23809523809523808,0.047619047619047616,0.19047619047619047,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047619047619047616,0.0,0.0,0.047619047619047616,0.047619047619047616,0.14285714285714285,0.0,0.7619047619047619,0.056918498168498165,0.2594752186588921,0.0,0,0.0,345,75.76,43.08,21.33,52.99,16.43,15.36,79.71,52.17,9.28,4.06,1.74,0.00,1.74,0.58,0.00,5.22,9.28,12.17,11.59,2.90,8.12,0.29,14.78,7.54,3.77,0.29,1.16,2.03,9.57,5.51,4.06,0.29,2.61,0.00,3.77,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.58,12.46,0.87,1.16,3.48,3.77,0.87,5.22,1.16,0.29,0.00,0.87,1.16,1.16,0.00,0.00,0.00,7.54,0.00,2.90,2.32,3.77,0.00,2.03,12.46,0.00,12.46,2.61,7.25,3.19,0.29,0.00,0.00,1.16,0.00,0.58,0.29,0.00,0.00,0.29,0.00,0.00,16.52,6.09,6.96,0.29,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.58,0.00,0.00,1.16,1.45

t3_374p4i,"> the rise in technology that has resulted in higher production from labour has little affect on wages. i agree with the point you made in this paragraph, but that's kind of the point! if market forces resulted in higher wages, nobody would care about minimum wage. the fact that minimum wage forces companies to pay employees more than what supply and demand would otherwise dictate is a feature, not a bug. > at least to me, these seem like temporary work done by people in the process of finding higher paying employment (students, recent graduates, new immigrants etc...), and not intended as a career at all, so a livable wage is not required. if all of the minimum wage jobs went to kids, recent graduates, recent immigrants, etc or whatever, what would the rest of the adults do? do you think they would just magically find themselves in ""real careers"" and the problem would go away? i think this is compounded by the fact that for better or for worse, we live in a society with social safety nets. the fact is our country will do its best to take care of these people one way or another. unless you want to totally change all that (maybe you do, but the scope of this cmv gets a bit wider), then the two go hand in hand. if you are a company and want an employee to work for you, part of the forces that dictate the cost of labor is the fact that the government is going to make up the shortfall to keep this people alive. > so while those who retain their minimum wage jobs will be better off, many will simply be replaced, leaving the unemployed workers in a worse position than before. i think this is an interesting point, but the post-automation economy is something we are going to have to deal with either way. in the big picture, i think an economy with fully automated restaurants has a lot of upside. i am all for increasing automation. but yes, we need to figure out what to do with the people who we do not *need* to work. but to me, this does not seem like a problem with minimum wage, that's an inevitable problem with the future of technology.",crjnv8h,1231.2091818957883,0,1432506614,62,14,779,0,66.14575334496801,382.0,538.0,18.0,54,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.2777777777777778,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.4444444444444445,0.040149393090569564,0.2356020942408377,0.0,0,0.0,382,86.22,52.09,37.63,39.83,22.47,16.23,91.88,54.97,12.57,5.50,1.83,1.31,1.57,0.00,0.79,7.07,9.69,16.23,9.16,2.09,5.76,1.57,15.97,5.76,5.50,1.57,0.52,3.14,3.40,2.09,1.31,0.00,0.00,0.00,6.54,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,17.80,2.36,2.88,3.93,3.40,2.62,5.50,0.79,0.26,0.00,0.52,1.31,0.52,0.52,0.00,0.26,9.42,1.57,1.83,4.45,1.31,1.57,0.79,13.35,1.83,13.35,2.62,8.38,2.36,9.16,0.26,0.00,3.66,0.00,0.26,0.52,0.00,0.00,0.52,0.00,0.00,14.92,4.45,6.02,0.00,0.00,0.52,0.26,0.26,0.52,0.52,1.05,1.31

(additionally, something inherent in either eating the fruit, disobeying god, or both, caused a loss of innocence which we see manifested initially in the fact that they suddenly became ashamed of the nakedness they were once ignorant to. the significance of this is mostly just that eating of the tree had negative consequences which could have been avoided by mere obedience). this rules out any assertion that god was lying and, by extension, any assertion that he was untrustworthy (and therefore unjust in punishing distrust). a satisfying rebuttal here is the only way you could convince me that god lied. > unreasonable punishments by what standard or measure are these punishments unreasonable? how is that standard or measure comparable to the standards and measures of an omniscient, omnipotent god, the only possible source of non-arbitrary morality? a satisfying answer to these questions is the only way you could convince me that god made unreasonable punishments. since these are the three reasons you say god is the ""bad guy,"" these are the things you have to address to really prove it. i also take some issue with your idea of bad guy, which you didn't clearly define. if by ""bad guy"" you mean the individual or force responsible for the current, inferior state of mankind, it makes much more sense to place the blame on mankind itself (for disobeying the rules and incurring the punishment) and/or the serpent (for trying to get mankind to disobey). those are the bad guys. i mean, if you are suffering in prison for a long time, who is to blame? is it the lawmakers? is it the police? is it the judge? or is it yourself/whoever may have tempted to you break the law?",crqd8az,1217.1888769281802,0,1433035557,665,66,5353,0,56.124552476147215,568.0,887.0,31.0,0,0.06451612903225806,0.0967741935483871,0.03225806451612903,0.3225806451612903,0.0,0.03225806451612903,0.0,0.03225806451612903,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03225806451612903,0.0,0.6129032258064515,0.12779220779220782,0.25528169014084506,0.0,0,0.0,580,65.75,64.79,12.64,1.77,20.00,21.21,86.55,54.31,14.66,5.52,1.03,0.34,2.59,0.17,1.38,9.14,9.31,11.55,8.28,5.17,6.21,1.38,13.97,3.10,1.38,2.24,1.03,2.07,5.86,1.38,4.31,0.34,1.90,0.52,7.24,0.00,0.86,0.00,1.03,17.76,4.48,3.45,1.38,6.55,2.07,3.97,1.21,0.34,0.34,0.00,2.24,0.00,0.86,0.00,1.38,9.83,0.52,0.52,6.38,0.52,2.24,3.28,8.97,0.52,6.21,0.17,3.45,2.41,0.86,0.00,0.17,0.17,2.93,1.38,0.34,0.00,0.00,0.17,0.00,0.17,18.62,3.62,6.38,0.52,0.00,1.72,0.00,0.52,1.03,0.69,2.76,1.38

t3_2yd5o8,"> i do not think countries should expect their immigrants to abandon their culture in exchange for a new one integration does not necessarily mean abandoning one's culture. it usually means adhering to the core values of their host society. it is not about having your holidays, food and history. it is about accepting the fact that the lowest acceptable common denominator of a country is its shared values, in the case of the western world they are freedom of religion, equality, democracy and generally liberal ideals. additionally it is important to learn the language spoken in your host country so you would be better suited to contribute and participate in it. nobody is complaining about indians or chinese people bringing their culture so long that they are willing to work hard and share the common values. most of the complaints revolve around immigrants who either do not wish to participate or wish to enforce values which are in direct conflict to the existing ones. > i think the idea that immigrants need to integrate into the culture of their host nations stems from racism culture is not race. and yes, the culture is somehow superior in the sense that the immigrants wish to go to those countries mostly due to their values of freedom and success. those are directly tied to their culture. > in ethnically homogeneous countries like sweden, the anti-immigrant sentiment (i believe) is legitimately racist. i understand that swedes have a lot of pride in their country and cultural history, but expecting muslim immigrants to love it as much as they do is absurd. immigrants came to sweden, not vice versa, if they can not contribute as functioning members of society then sweden has no need for immigrants. this is not some high lofty ideal. this is a purely pragmatic point of view. they do not need them to ""love"" their culture nor are swedes obligated to ""love"" their guest's culture. but the guests need to pay for their stay through productivity and participation without trying to remove the core values by which the country functions. this is not comparable to the us issues with immigration because immigration from mexico for example is not trying to challenge core ideals on which the state was founded on, it is a completely irrelevant comparison.",cp8ejkw,691.1816005112422,0,1425848756,66,13,713,0,49.833878009863696,383.0,613.0,18.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.2222222222222222,0.05555555555555555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1111111111111111,0.05555555555555555,0.0,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.0,0.5,0.05558044896280191,0.2689295039164491,0.0,0,0.0,384,75.28,66.17,20.92,96.56,21.33,25.26,83.85,52.08,12.50,6.51,1.04,0.26,0.78,0.00,4.43,5.99,6.51,15.62,8.33,2.86,5.47,3.91,14.06,4.43,2.86,1.04,0.26,1.56,7.81,6.25,1.30,0.00,0.00,0.78,13.02,0.00,0.52,0.00,0.00,15.89,2.86,0.78,3.91,3.12,1.30,4.95,1.04,0.26,0.26,0.26,1.04,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.26,5.99,1.82,2.86,1.04,0.78,0.00,1.30,11.46,1.56,11.20,1.56,7.81,1.56,1.56,0.26,0.00,0.52,0.52,0.00,0.26,0.00,0.00,0.26,0.00,0.00,10.42,4.69,2.60,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.26,1.04,0.52,0.52,0.78

t3_35foy9,"i think the abortion debate is complex and nuanced, but it really does come down clearly on one side. when you are weighing the well being of one person against that of a small pocket of cells it makes sense to choose the person. when that bunch of cells gets a bit bigger and begins to exhibit more complex behaviour rather than simple chemical processes, things get more difficult. so sure, abortion does have some points where i feel it is inappropriate, later in the pregnancy. that said, when we make laws we do not go by what you and i think. contrary to popular belief legal theory is actually very different to common sense. there are two major ways of codifying law. one is to start with no rights and specifically grant them as you go. this can mean saying it has been shown that interracial marriage should be allowed and now will be, but before it was shown to be a net positive it was banned. the other is to start with all rights and restrict when it is shown to reduce harm. an example of this is murder. there are almost no cases where murder is ok, but self defence does protect someone at least in part. assault is illegal, but there are degrees and sometimes it is impossible to enforce. so in the case of abortion we should be using this second method. we should be protecting the rights of those we disagree with to make their own autonomous moral decisions because we can't show that this definitely causes overall harm to society. furthermore, we can actually show that countries which ban abortion are pretty shitty places to live, and places which make it legal are pretty awesome to live in.",cr4288e,454.9880945456782,0,1431221611,184,26,-17247,0,67.38670021186445,295.0,421.0,16.0,2,0.125,0.0,0.3125,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0625,0.0,1.0625,0.021794871794871794,0.26101694915254237,0.0,0,0.0,295,34.44,64.55,32.67,25.77,18.44,16.95,87.80,55.59,13.90,5.08,1.02,2.37,1.02,0.00,0.68,8.81,3.73,12.20,12.54,7.46,6.78,1.36,19.32,6.78,3.05,3.05,1.69,2.71,6.10,3.05,3.05,0.00,1.36,0.00,7.80,0.68,0.00,0.00,0.00,17.29,3.73,2.71,1.69,2.71,2.03,4.75,2.37,0.68,0.68,0.34,3.05,0.34,2.37,1.69,0.34,7.12,2.71,0.00,2.37,1.02,1.02,1.36,16.61,0.34,10.51,1.36,5.08,3.73,1.36,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.68,0.68,1.36,0.34,0.00,0.68,0.34,0.00,9.15,5.42,3.39,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.34,0.00,0.00

t3_2z1yoq,"i think you know part of the story about inflation, but you are missing some important parts of the puzzle. it might be easier to go over to /r/explainlikeimfive, but i will try to explain it here. like a lot of things in economics, inflation is about supply and demand. if the economy is good and people are spending money, then the amount of money in circulation increases, and if the supply of money in circulation increases, then the value of money decreases. this is called inflation. on the other hand, if the economy is bad and people are hoarding money, then the supply of money in circulation will decrease, and the value of money will go up. this is deflation. this is why 2-3% inflation is considered good. if the economy is good and people are spending money, then there will be 2-3% inflation independent of any government intervention. people's bank accounts are the source of the extra money, not the government. if the inflation rate is lower, it means people are not spending money, which is bad. if it is higher, it means there is an underlying economic problem causing the excess inflation. as for the government, they have four ways to affect the supply of money, which in turn affects the inflation rate. 1. they can make a law that requires banks to hold more money in their safes. this means less money is available for the banks to lend to people, which decreases the supply of money. 2. when banks need loans, they have to get it from the federal reserve. if the fed gives out really low interest loans, the banks can give out low interest loans too. this means more people will get the loans, and this will increase the supply of money and the inflation rate. if the fed give out high interest loans, then there will be deflation. 3. the government buys and sells government bonds. if they buy back more of them, then more people will have cash from the sale, which increases the supply of money. if they sell more bonds, then there will be less money in the economy. 4. governments also have the ability to print money. this can directly impact the supply of money in the way you say. when germany did it during the great depression, their money became worthless. when zimbabwe did it, the same thing happened. if the government pockets the extra money or uses it to pay off debts, then printing money functions as a regressive tax. as a result, governments never use this method to impact the economy as part of sound economic policy. they only do it as a way to replace physical money that is destroyed through wear and tear. also remember that only 2-8% of money is stored in physical currency. the rest of it is stored digitally. **so, you are absolutely right about that fourth method. it is a regressive tax, and a terrible idea. but that does not mean that controlled inflation overall is not a sound economic policy.**",cpezlhg,309.0807071754535,0,1426371882,131,19,2643,0,67.7026198540907,505.0,750.0,38.0,51,0.05263157894736842,0.02631578947368421,0.10526315789473684,0.2631578947368421,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02631578947368421,0.23684210526315788,0.0,0.7105263157894736,0.08764148764148764,0.19603960396039605,0.0,0,0.0,516,74.59,53.10,12.01,25.77,13.58,16.86,87.02,51.74,9.30,2.91,0.39,0.00,0.78,0.00,1.74,6.40,9.69,12.02,9.69,4.26,8.72,0.97,16.67,4.84,3.29,1.55,2.33,2.91,4.26,2.13,2.13,0.00,0.19,1.16,5.43,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,10.85,2.33,2.13,2.52,3.68,0.58,4.07,0.78,0.00,0.58,0.19,1.16,0.39,0.39,0.00,0.39,7.95,0.00,0.39,5.81,1.16,0.58,1.55,12.40,3.49,9.69,2.13,5.04,2.71,5.62,0.00,0.00,11.43,0.00,0.00,0.39,0.00,0.19,0.19,0.00,0.00,15.70,7.36,5.81,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.58,0.00,0.19,0.00,1.74

t3_3a6gq1,">my childhood consisted of me running away from my problems. sports became the enabler for me to do that. i was a grown man in some ways when i turned 18 and moved out of the house, but in other ways, i was a complete mental midget. i was not prepared at all for the world. i felt like every other boy and girl had a parent that would sit them down and teach them things about life, happiness, morals, relationships, hobbies, etc. meanwhile, i practically lived at home alone (no siblings, alcoholic father), and i never took advantage of that time to become an independent man. i just stuck my head in a pretend world for 6 years (junior high and high school), and was shocked that i was not ready for the world when i left high school. nobody's ready for life after high school, nor have they reached full maturity. you are just more prepared than you were after middle school. it sounds like you had a rough upbringing, and you are trying to blame any later problems on sports, rather than your home environment. your father would have been an alcoholic whether you played sports or not, he wouldn't have provided any additional guidance, and you being out of the house and away from that negative presence may have been a good thing. considering your situation, what would have happened if you had not had that outlet of sports, which consumed most of your time? if you were canning kids in what little free time you had, what do you think you would have done with even more free time? do you honestly think you would have done something suddenly productive, or is it more likely that you would have gotten into some more serious trouble? i think youth sports give kids, especially those with a troubled background, a distraction and diversion away from a life full of temptations and opportunities to go south. it might not be as productive as, say, joining an after school study group, but most of kids are not interested in that. it is more important that they get exposure to clean, wholesome entertainment which will not lead them down a path of destruction, even if this is not the most productive activity possible.",cs9psry,1145.0901139079801,0,1434563463,25,8,1081,0,65.29178323297825,381.0,535.0,17.0,35,0.0,0.0,0.17647058823529413,0.0,0.0,0.058823529411764705,0.0,0.058823529411764705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17647058823529413,0.0,0.47058823529411764,0.06125992063492063,0.2545931758530184,0.0,0,0.0,383,38.62,56.23,61.27,44.93,22.53,16.19,93.99,58.22,17.23,10.44,4.18,0.00,4.70,0.26,1.31,6.79,4.96,13.05,12.01,3.39,6.27,3.66,18.02,8.09,4.96,2.09,0.52,3.92,6.01,3.39,2.35,0.00,0.52,0.26,10.44,1.04,0.00,0.26,1.57,16.97,2.35,1.57,3.39,4.96,1.31,5.74,1.04,0.00,0.52,0.52,1.83,0.26,1.57,0.00,0.52,7.31,1.31,1.31,2.87,1.57,1.04,7.57,7.05,1.31,14.10,1.57,8.36,4.18,3.13,2.87,1.04,0.52,0.26,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,13.32,3.66,7.05,0.00,0.00,0.78,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.52,1.04,0.26

t3_3fnkrz,"at least in the usa, the government is a democracy, in which all people should have a say. the government should therefore mirror all its peoples' interests. the group for chronically ill does exist, so is it not fair that they at least receive some recognition in government? if people have an interest in having government-subsidized chronic disease healthcare then the government should at least somewhat represent those people. when one observes the art and literature left behind from the black death, one can see that the people were suffering. grotesque images of the infected as well as hysteria over what caused the disease ran rampant. the misery of the general public could not be understated, as a force outside their control killed their loved ones without discretion. if such a kind of suffering was to happen, and people knew exactly who was to blame, is it not reasonable to conclude that deaths of chronically ill which affected people would cause the affected to conduct civil unrest? the argument that gdp will increase is somewhat flawed by itself. the government has actually produced something known as a stimulus check to boost consumer spending in times of recession. taxdollars which go through the government would still increase the country's gdp because the government still spends money on subsidizing chronic medication. if the proposed system of removing government funding was introduced, then that same money would instead go directly to charities and thereby go to health expenditure. the gdp would remain the same because the government no longer is allowed to tax for chronic illness in the proposed system. the government would still keep the same amount of usable revenue because of an equal decrease in expenditures and an equal decrease in revenue. in addition to this, chronic illness can range from ~~mile~~ mild to immediate death upon removal of medication. those people who have chronic asthma are not really burdening society, but their malady can still be classified as chronic. how does one draw the line between that and something more severe, like crohn's disease? some people who would otherwise be happily be living would be killed in the name of euthanization. if the government was to apply this same principle to other minority groups, the government might as well kill all seniors over 80 years of age. obviously, they were suffering from old age, right? 80 years is definitely the right cutoff age and is definitely not an arbitrarily drawn number, right?",ctq9oiz,274.5765238445076,0,1438660939,51,16,2493,0,50.2139430894309,410.0,663.0,21.0,3,0.09523809523809523,0.09523809523809523,0.2857142857142857,0.23809523809523808,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14285714285714285,0.0,0.857142857142857,0.09678751803751802,0.275609756097561,0.0,0,0.0,412,84.46,53.88,20.33,22.02,19.62,27.43,86.65,50.49,7.04,1.21,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.21,5.83,9.47,13.83,10.19,4.37,6.31,1.70,14.08,4.61,4.37,2.18,1.21,3.88,5.10,2.43,2.67,0.24,1.21,0.97,6.55,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,15.29,1.21,3.64,3.64,3.16,1.94,3.88,1.21,0.73,0.24,0.00,5.34,0.00,5.10,0.00,0.00,6.07,0.73,0.00,5.34,0.00,0.00,2.91,7.28,0.97,14.56,2.18,6.55,6.07,4.37,0.24,0.00,2.67,0.00,1.46,0.49,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.49,0.00,10.68,3.88,3.64,0.00,0.00,1.21,0.00,0.24,0.00,0.73,0.00,0.97

t3_37b2pr,"it is quite normal and natural for a language to incorporate words from other languages into its vocabulary. i'm not sure ""bodylore"" would be easier than ""anatomy"" for an english language learner to learn since many languages use the same root english does for their word for anatomy. for example: * french - anatomie * german - anatomie * swahili - anatomia * nepali - anatomi (if i am reading the devanagari right) * bhasa indonesia - anatomi * kurdish - anatomi * oromo - anaatoomiii * tagalog - anatomiya etc. english already uses a lot of latin and greek suffixes and prefixes which a lot of other languages use, so you would just be one set of prefixes and suffixes with another (and more obscure it seems) set of prefixes. and languages generally do not alter their grammar just because they have adopted foreign words or phrases into their vocabulary, they usually adopt the word and fit it into their own grammar and even phonology. for example the amharic word for ""hotel"" is ""hotel"" and when you want to say the ""the hotel"" you simply add ""-u"" to the word, becoming ""hotelu"" like you would with any amharic word. i'm not sure how much having an english language regulator would change grammar, since that's intrinsic to the language itself. one of the main problems with english is that it is a widely spoken language, and the majority of speakers are outside of the language's ""homeland."" so when it comes to spelling reforms, whose pronunciation would you use? certainly the english could lay claim to it, but exactly which english pronunciation? so you might end up basing new spelling conventions on the speech on a small subset of english speakers, which actually is not all that useful.",crl78po,426.61319878452497,0,1432640835,120,7,6569,0,39.70565189259139,281.0,469.0,11.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.09090909090909091,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09090909090909091,0.0,0.18181818181818182,0.18181818181818182,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5454545454545454,0.10797979797979798,0.24555160142348753,0.0,0,0.0,281,68.18,69.08,4.29,52.47,25.55,28.47,74.02,51.25,12.10,5.69,1.07,0.00,2.49,0.00,2.14,6.41,7.12,13.17,8.54,4.98,7.12,1.42,12.81,2.85,1.78,2.49,0.71,3.56,2.14,1.78,0.36,0.00,0.00,0.00,8.90,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,16.37,1.42,3.56,3.20,3.91,1.78,3.91,1.78,0.00,1.78,0.00,0.36,0.36,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.78,0.00,0.00,1.07,0.36,0.36,0.71,9.25,0.36,7.47,0.71,3.91,2.85,1.42,1.42,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.36,0.00,0.36,0.00,0.00,0.00,21.71,3.20,2.85,0.36,0.00,0.71,0.00,3.20,5.69,1.42,1.42,2.85

t3_30fhxx,"well one theory concerning a universe with no beginning or end would be the cyclic model, where the big bang was not so much a bang, but rather a bounce. the cyclic model in basic terms puts forward the idea that the universe expands and contracts in a cycle forever; so the big bounce would cause the expansion of the universe, and eventually the forces of gravity from all the mass in the universe would pull everything back together i.e. the big crunch. once this point is reached, another big bounce would occur and the universe would again expand, with this process continuing ad infinitum. however, the big argument against such a model of the universe currently would be that from our observations, the expansion of the universe does not seem to be slowing down, and is actually speeding up. this means that gravity is having a negligible effect on expansion and/or some other force is actually increasing the rate of expansion, and therefore it would be not be possible for the universe to pull back on itself and have the big crunch happen. one possible explanation for this being the presence of ""dark energy"" which hypothetically exerts negative pressure on space, but i digress. eventually the constant expansion of the universe would lead to the ""heat death"" of the universe and matter itself will decay. anyway, cyclical model is just one theory, and so is accelerating universe, it could be that our observations are simply not on anywhere near a large enough length of time to draw accurate conclusions on these ideas. there are many many other theories regarding the origins of the universe, but you are right in saying that regular old big bang theory gets talked about disproportionately; and many physicists have moved on to other, more complex models. hope this was at least slightly helpful, here are a few links to various bits and bobs i mentioned: ",cps47py,82.23144893552117,0,1427426278,56,15,-13619,0,44.3855480033985,321.0,504.0,11.0,0,0.18181818181818182,0.09090909090909091,0.45454545454545453,0.6363636363636364,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.3636363636363638,0.10474358974358974,0.2523364485981308,0.0,0,0.0,322,76.12,35.46,87.66,31.05,32.20,22.36,86.02,54.97,8.07,1.55,0.62,0.62,0.31,0.00,0.00,6.52,10.87,12.11,10.25,7.14,6.21,1.86,13.98,4.97,0.93,0.62,1.55,3.73,2.17,1.24,0.93,0.31,0.31,0.00,3.11,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,17.08,2.80,2.17,3.42,4.04,1.24,5.28,0.62,0.31,0.31,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,5.59,1.24,0.31,4.04,0.31,0.00,1.24,9.01,1.24,22.67,3.42,14.91,5.90,0.31,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.31,0.62,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.31,0.31,10.87,3.42,4.97,0.31,0.62,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.24,0.00,0.00,0.31

t3_2xjpp4,"there are several aspects you do not seem to be taking into account. first the grizzly has never seen a unicorn. i think this point is very important as animals tend to be very cautious with environments/things/animals they do not know. i am assuming the battle takes place in an environement where there is only one unicorn, but grizzlies are usual: the unicorn has probably already seen a grizzly. this could give the unicorn an big advantage an allow it to deal the first blow/ wound. as you mentioned, the wound would probably take time to affect the grizzly ability to fight. but i think it is safe to assume that a unicorn runs faster than a grizzly in the long run, so the unicorn can just wait for the wound to hurt the grizzly. (i am assuming they are fighting in an arena big enough for this strategy to be possible) another asset of the unicorn which you do not take into account is the kick. if you have ever seen a horse do a kick, you know how agile, quick and devastating it can be. if the unicorn charges and misses the grizzly, then it can still kick it to the head, as the grizzly would probably not expect it. i admit i am not sure how smart a unicorn is supposed to be, but a legendary animal like this is probably not stupid.",cp0qcwm,404.7359530322615,0,1425206494,22,0,6665,0,61.74338212634825,236.0,344.0,11.0,2,0.0,0.0,0.36363636363636365,0.45454545454545453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09090909090909091,0.09090909090909091,1.0,0.11468253968253968,0.211864406779661,0.0,0,0.0,238,56.91,36.84,41.74,14.22,21.64,18.91,86.97,59.66,11.34,5.46,2.52,0.00,2.10,0.00,0.84,5.88,12.18,10.08,12.61,7.56,5.88,2.94,21.43,4.62,2.52,1.68,1.26,0.84,5.04,2.10,2.94,0.00,1.68,1.26,5.04,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,15.97,3.78,1.68,2.52,5.04,1.26,5.04,1.68,1.26,0.00,0.42,1.68,0.42,1.26,0.00,0.00,6.72,0.00,2.10,2.10,2.10,0.84,2.10,18.91,0.84,10.92,1.26,5.04,5.04,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.84,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,10.50,4.62,3.36,0.42,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.84,1.26
t3_3g8r7o,"perhaps this would be more successful, but i do not think there is a good solution. the problem is, when someone pirates something, its not necessarily a lost sale. all of the major sources of pirated content is from third world or poorer countries where people would not have paid for it anyways. most companies are fucking retarded because they do not understand this concept, so they think they are losing money out the ass when they see thousands or millions of pirated copies being downloaded. in reality, its much less than that. but the concept of making things cheaper or easily accessible also runs into this problem. steam, for example, is so successful in offering cheap games, but its really only successful in first world countries. if you like in the us spending $1 on a game might be trivial, in other parts of the world that could easily be a day's worth of food. just $5 for a movie might be nothing for you, but i could buy many days worth of food back in my home country. to make matters worse you can't just change the price based on the region either, that's where things like g2a come in where people buy keys from where they are cheapest and sell it on the international market. therefore, companies either do not make it cheaper, or they use region locking to try to stop this practice. the reason i believe the issue is more complicated than it seems is the idea of reducing the price might not bring in enough people. for example blu-ray movies are in the $10 range if they are old/less popular, $20 for popular movies, and more for newer/very popular movies. if they halve the price would double the people buy it? quadruple? i am not so sure.",ctvxixr,294.6591963095057,0,1439048916,42,0,-21523,0,69.59695338628764,299.0,418.0,16.0,1,0.0625,0.0625,0.25,0.5625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0625,0.04203296703296703,0.25752508361204013,0.0,0,0.0,305,54.23,31.15,60.67,43.71,19.06,17.70,90.82,54.75,12.13,5.57,1.64,0.33,0.98,0.00,2.62,6.56,6.89,12.13,9.84,6.56,6.56,2.95,16.72,8.20,5.57,1.97,2.95,3.93,6.23,3.61,2.62,0.00,0.33,0.66,7.54,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,20.33,2.95,3.61,3.28,5.25,1.31,8.20,0.33,0.33,0.00,0.00,1.31,0.33,0.00,0.33,0.66,7.54,0.98,2.95,1.64,1.64,1.64,0.66,12.79,0.98,13.11,1.31,9.18,2.95,2.30,2.30,0.33,6.23,0.00,0.00,1.31,0.98,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.33,13.44,4.59,4.92,0.00,0.00,0.66,0.00,0.33,0.00,0.98,0.00,1.97

t3_3295fa,"this is too much to address all at once, so i will just defend non-state capitalism, and criticize state-socialism and state-capitalism. >the bourgeoisie are oppressing the proletariat, just look at chinese manufacturing by nike, and mexican maquiladoras by and large, in developing countries, these factory jobs are better than the alternatives. people are being payed more to work these factory jobs than they would be working as a farmer, or doing some other work. yes the capitalists who own the factories are taking part of the profits, but they provided the capital, and without their capital, the workers would still be stuck as peasant farmers. for people in poorer countries to capture even higher wages and better working conditions, they need to accumulate more capital, and become more skilled, a process which can take several generations. capitalism has fueled this process of wealth accumulation, work force improvement and technological development in all of the wealthiest countries. indeed this process is working in the developing world, chinese incomes have been multiplied by 10 or more over the last few decades. >inevitability of monopolies, which eliminate competition and gouge consumers and works. monopolies are not inevitable in every industry. some industries are natural monopolies, the largest company can crush smaller companies with low production costs and prices, but in other industries smaller firms and start ups can be competitive. a lot depends on the regulation of monopolies by the government. governments sometimes regulate natural monopolies in a smart way, but usually the government is captured by industry interests and actually creates monopolies, through licensure or prohibitive regulation or some other means. >lack of centralized planning, which results in overproduction of some good and underproduction of others, encouraging economic crises such as inflation, slumps, depressions. i'm sorry, but you think a government controlled economy would result in a more stability? if the government is controlled democratically, it will be subject to the whims of the people, and will be under pressure to fuel bubbles and unsustainable credit booms, not to mention squandering tax money on direct subsidies for inefficient businesses. if the government is controlled by private interests, it will take advantage of its regulatory powers and tax revenue to enrich connected people, and in fact will over time capture and move most of the country's wealth out of the country, to more safe places. if you want an example of the instability of a state planned economy, look no further than venezuela today, which has shortages in many goods and services, and has no more than a year left of reserves before it runs out of money. >demands for labor-saving machinery, which horse unemployment and a more hostile proletariat. i do not know exactly what this means, but i will take it to mean labor-saving machinery results in lower wages and unemployment? not true, the economic history of every capitalist country refutes this. saving on labor costs makes production more efficient, and benefits everyone in the long run. >employers will tend to maximize profits by reducing labor expenses, thus creating a situation where workers will not have enough income to buy the goods produced, creating the contradiction of causing profits to fall. this point has been refuted many times. it is been 150 years of the facts not matching this story. when will marxists give it up? >control of the state by the wealthy, the effect of which is passage of laws favoring themselves. agreed. managing the government is a tricky thing. but you think the answer is giving the government total control over the economy? i do not understand you. you think a state planned economy would be more successful than capitalism, but you criticize capitalism for the possibility that the state may start to plan it! those running communist country are just as susceptible to greed and the influence of private interest as those running capitalist countries.",cq94r7i,3123.054232768476,0,1428788282,78,19,7635,0,39.211755087209326,645.0,1122.0,32.0,0,0.0,0.03125,0.25,0.125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03125,0.03125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0625,0.53125,0.0751706042218376,0.28217054263565894,0.0,0,0.0,652,86.02,41.51,27.90,69.15,20.38,30.67,86.66,46.63,7.67,2.45,0.77,0.00,0.92,0.00,0.77,5.21,7.67,13.65,8.28,2.15,7.06,1.53,13.96,6.75,4.91,1.53,0.46,4.14,6.29,4.29,1.99,0.15,0.92,0.61,4.29,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,14.57,1.84,3.22,1.53,2.76,1.99,5.06,0.46,0.31,0.15,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,14.11,0.31,3.83,8.13,2.45,0.77,0.92,9.97,1.84,11.35,0.92,7.82,2.61,11.20,0.31,0.15,6.44,0.00,0.00,0.31,0.00,0.00,0.31,0.00,0.00,13.34,4.14,6.44,0.00,0.00,0.61,0.15,0.77,0.00,0.31,0.00,0.92

t3_35zguh,"i am not sure if this is against the rules but i am going to say that both viewpoints are correct...from a subjective (lol) viewpoint. all people in the world clearly do not agree on a moral standard in all areas. never have, never will. what is generally accepted to be right and wrong changes. slavery for millennia was commonplace and not seen as wrong. heck, africans sold their own people into slavery. so in both of these senses, morality can be seen as subjective. yet despite the opinions of the past, slavery is wrong. this is a fact. mental gymnastics and culture was what tricked people into thinking it was ok. so in that sense there is an objective morality. just because people do not agree or change opinions does not mean that truth does not exist. but then on the subjective side, there are very hard moral choices sometimes. use a classic example, killing hitler before he became a dictator. is it wrong because it is murder or right because it saves lives? i am such a case and in less extreme cases, there may not be an answer and it is up to the individual to decide their course of action, in other words, it is subjective. this may not make sense at first, but consider another dilemma. you have extra money to spend and can't decide whether you want to donate it to charity or buy your girlfriend a present. is there really a wrong answer here? would it be morally wrong to spend the money on yourself even? no. therefore not all choices are as black and white as right and wrong. even in the hitler example, there is no wrong choice because we simply do not have enough information. would killing him cause an alternate future that is even worse? would killing him solve every modern problem we have? there is no way to know without being an advanced time traveler or god. therefore it is subjective to the individual to choose what seems best to them. however, if you chose to kill or not kill because you wanted to mess things up as much as possible, that would be wrong. sometimes our attitude is more important than the action itself. however, if you are unaware at age 42 that drinking in driving is illegal and all around bad idea and you drive drunk and kill someone, you should not be exempt from responsibility simply because you are an idiot. so in that sense morality is objective. so basically morality is complex, though it is spun to be more complex than it is, i agree with you. it is generally easy to determine whether something is right, wrong, or neutral. i have found many controversial topics to be controversial not for their complexity but because people are selfish and try to make it complex so they are justified. that said, some things truly are complex.",cr9h75a,231.85874844986725,0,1431652207,99,17,13226,0,69.74543650793655,490.0,714.0,36.0,0,0.027777777777777776,0.05555555555555555,0.19444444444444445,0.4722222222222222,0.0,0.0,0.027777777777777776,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.0,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.05555555555555555,0.0,0.9444444444444445,0.04619047619047619,0.21428571428571427,0.0,0,0.0,492,23.78,35.71,65.39,3.87,14.06,19.72,92.28,59.35,12.60,5.49,1.02,0.61,2.24,0.61,1.02,7.11,4.67,11.59,13.01,7.11,9.96,4.07,18.90,7.52,2.85,1.02,0.41,3.05,7.52,2.64,4.88,0.00,1.83,0.00,6.91,0.00,0.20,0.00,0.61,23.98,6.50,3.46,2.24,4.27,2.64,7.93,2.24,0.81,0.41,0.20,0.61,0.00,0.20,0.00,0.41,6.71,1.02,1.02,2.24,0.41,2.64,2.85,14.84,1.22,10.77,2.03,5.89,2.85,0.41,0.81,0.00,1.63,1.42,1.42,1.42,0.41,0.20,0.81,0.00,0.00,12.40,6.71,4.07,0.00,0.00,1.02,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.20,0.41,0.00

t3_3ekjn3,"i think there is a lot that can be said about subtle ways in which black and hispanic students are at a disadvantage in the admissions process, and i agree with other commenters who are making this point, but i actually want to come at this issue from a slightly different direction. consider the admissions process not from the perspective of the student, but from the perspective of the college. the college's job is not to find and admit the ""best"" or ""smartest"" students, whatever that might mean, but rather to admit the students who are going to benefit the college the most. most admissions officers, especially at elite private schools in the u.s., will readily admit this if asked. you can argue that this is somehow ""unfair,"" but remember that the first and most important job of a college is to maximize its own ability to do high-quality education and research. admitting a racially diverse student body helps the college achieve this aim in a variety of ways: 1. it helps attract a larger applicant pool. some students applying to college value ""diversity"" and will choose to apply to colleges with visible racial minorities preferentially over colleges that are dominated by white students. conversely, very few students will cross a college off their list because it is ""too diverse."" so the college has nothing to lose and everything to gain in terms of attracting more applicants if there is more visible diversity. colleges would always rather have more applicants than they can admit because then they appear more selective, and thus more prestigious. 2. it keeps alumni and donors happy (who value the perception that the college is ""diverse""), who will then give the college more money which it can spend on things like increasing the quality of its programs or providing more financial aid to needy students. 3. it increases the number of student perspectives on campus, broadening the range of discourse in and out of classes and leading to a higher-quality education as students are exposed to a broader set of ideas and experiences. 4. it gives the college a broader alumni base in communities other than those dominated by whites and/or asians. this helps increase the college's general name recognition and prestige. i should note that this approach to the admissions process is typical of private colleges and universities (and a few top-tier public universities) in the u.s. it is much less true of large state schools and essentially nonexistent outside the u.s. however, it is these same u.s. private colleges and universities that are most likely to use affirmative action in their decisions, so i think the point stands.",ctg4na1,231.20035343673894,0,1437869177,59,8,-679,0,53.20380471380474,440.0,713.0,27.0,3,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.2962962962962963,0.14814814814814814,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.037037037037037035,0.037037037037037035,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07407407407407407,0.0,0.6666666666666666,NaN,0.26136363636363635,0.0,0,0.0,448,81.76,54.45,25.04,55.21,23.58,28.12,86.38,50.00,10.71,2.23,1.12,0.00,0.22,0.00,0.89,8.48,8.71,12.95,6.92,3.35,7.81,0.67,12.28,8.48,5.80,1.56,1.12,4.02,4.69,3.12,1.56,0.00,0.67,0.22,7.14,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,14.06,4.24,1.34,1.79,3.35,1.12,4.46,1.79,1.12,0.22,0.00,0.22,0.22,0.00,0.00,0.00,9.15,1.12,2.46,6.47,1.12,0.45,0.67,10.27,1.79,8.93,1.79,6.25,0.89,10.49,0.22,0.00,0.67,0.00,0.00,0.22,0.00,0.00,0.22,0.00,0.00,14.29,6.03,3.12,0.22,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.67,2.68,0.45,0.89,0.22

t3_3d01ke,"> in a nutshell, i think punishment has actually caused far more evil than it is prevented and is really just an outlet for our inherent cruelty as a meat-eating species at the top of the food chain. punishing people we consider ""bad"" also has the effect of affirming our own self righteousness. we do not punish people to feel high and mighty. we punish people because they are a danger to society. this does not just mean locking up serial killers and rapists. it also means punishing idiots who think it is safe to drive 100+mph in a school zone. it is why we have speed limits. people who think driving insanely fast is safe are not inherently ""bad"" people, but they are dangerous and it is why we punish them. without punishments, nothing would steer away people from being violent or even being dangerous without the intent of being dangerous. i'd agree to some extent that the prison system is far from ideal, and should also focus on rehabilitation instead of just punishment. this, of course, is only for those getting out of prison again and not those serving a life sentence. furthermore, punishment is not something exclusive to humans. punishment is an effective way to keep order in a society and is used by other species too. here is an interesting article on the subject: ",ct0k2bf,548.8699529338915,0,1436699992,63,0,2039,0,63.515943747882105,227.0,337.0,13.0,0,0.38461538461538464,0.0,0.15384615384615385,0.23076923076923078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7692307692307694,0.12361111111111112,0.2599118942731278,0.0,0,0.0,229,52.43,56.95,32.88,1.00,16.36,19.65,88.65,55.90,11.35,5.24,0.87,3.06,0.00,0.00,1.31,6.11,6.55,13.10,11.35,6.99,6.11,3.49,16.16,6.55,1.75,1.75,0.44,0.87,11.79,2.18,9.61,0.00,6.55,0.00,9.61,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,15.28,3.93,3.49,1.31,1.31,0.44,6.11,0.44,0.00,0.00,0.44,2.62,0.00,0.87,0.44,1.31,15.72,3.06,1.31,7.42,0.44,3.93,0.44,12.23,0.00,8.73,1.31,6.11,1.31,0.87,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.44,0.87,0.44,0.00,0.44,0.00,0.00,12.66,5.68,3.06,0.44,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.44,1.75,0.44,0.00,0.87

t3_3bdv00,"alright so you are having an existential crisis, filled with angst and despair as you stare into the abyss. sit down and grab a beverage of your choice, then read on. first: you posit that life is meaningless because it is not infinite in duration. why would this be? currently i am listening to a great piece of music, it is duration is 3:58, so it will end soon. did that make the song meaningless? did it drain the melody or stop it from inducing emotion? no. there is absolutely no correlation between the length of something and its meaning. secondly you assume that you will experience nothingness, there are a couple of errors here: you fear the concept of nothingness. this is quite natural. the human brain is not quite capable of comprehending the void nor infinity. everytime you try to contemplate it, your brain will get confused, and a confused brain is an anxious one. it is just a natural byproduct of evolution, it has nothing to do with nothingness being inherently bad. more importantly though, you assume that you will experience this void, you wont. once you cease to be, you are no longer capable of experiencing this 'nothingness' that make you uncomfortable. thirdly: for the sake of argument assume there is a god that created the universe and there is a life after death. how does this give you anymore 'meaning' than the nihilistic alternative? it doesn't. whether a god create you and give you a destiny or the universe created you with a brain that harbors desires, goals and dreams, it is really equivalent in terms of 'meaning'. lastly give your life meaning by finding a goal ( i suggest life extension research ) to strive for. most people get existential angst from having a pointless life. emphasis on *point*. find a goal and go for it. in the meanwhile enjoy the ride, just like the movie/music you listen to will come to an end, so will most likely your existence, but that does not take away anything from the content of the life that you do have.",csla17d,287.99193163019254,0,1435510594,110,48,3954,0,68.14214285714286,350.0,515.0,25.0,3,0.0,0.0,0.04,0.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16,0.0,0.6,0.02542735042735043,0.26285714285714284,0.0,0,0.0,355,54.62,80.87,24.72,25.77,14.20,20.00,89.30,57.46,15.21,7.04,0.56,0.00,6.48,0.00,0.00,8.17,9.01,11.55,10.70,4.79,5.92,2.82,16.62,3.66,2.54,0.85,1.97,1.41,4.79,2.25,2.25,1.41,0.28,0.28,9.01,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,13.80,3.94,2.54,0.56,4.23,0.85,3.38,2.82,0.28,1.41,0.28,2.82,1.13,1.69,0.00,0.00,6.48,0.00,3.10,0.85,2.25,1.13,1.13,11.27,2.82,9.58,0.85,4.23,4.51,1.41,1.41,0.00,0.00,0.56,0.28,0.56,0.00,0.00,0.56,0.00,0.00,16.06,5.92,4.51,1.13,0.00,1.13,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.97,0.56,0.85
t3_3bdv00,"i would dispute the notion that life is a constant suffering. surely you do not live every single moment of your day in suffering. the human mind is not that powerful. if we didn't occasionally become distracted from any suffering that we do face in our lives, then we wouldn't be able to function properly. the vast majority of all people experience fleeting moments of happiness. additionally, the nature of suffering is something which many philosophers have attempted to understand. i am partial to the buddhist interpretation, which is that suffering is caused by unfulfilled desires and distractions from the reality of our lives. a seemingly well-off person who revels in fantasy all day long may be considerably more unhappy than a poor person who spends time trying to enjoy the life they actually live. to want something and not have it is often a cause of suffering. a common counter-point to this may be that perhaps someone is in poor health and experiences physical pain as a result. excluding only the most extreme examples where pain simply cannot be managed, what is the suffering truly caused by? most likely the bitterness at lacking in physical comfort or ability. however, one who embraces the reality of their health and works to maximize happiness within their limitations can still be a very happy person who does not always suffer. i think stephen hawking is a great example of a person with extreme physical disability, and yet he has lived a life that by many objective measures is considerably more fulfilling than the average person's. now we must consider suicide as a mechanism for rectifying the problem of meaning. suicide is just about the only way that you can completely remove all possibility of meaning and happiness from your life. therefore, i would consider the premise that suicide is a solution to this problem a complete contradiction. the fact that you have not killed yourself seems to suggest that you may recognize this on some level.",csl9q5t,196.4535108529467,0,1435509166,110,48,2526,0,47.92985362608121,334.0,553.0,18.0,0,0.0,0.1111111111111111,0.16666666666666666,0.2222222222222222,0.0,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.0,0.6111111111111112,0.029481792717086834,0.27844311377245506,0.0,0,0.0,336,66.38,70.40,16.59,6.15,18.67,27.38,91.07,54.76,13.39,6.25,1.19,1.79,2.08,0.30,0.89,7.14,8.63,12.50,11.01,5.36,3.57,2.38,17.56,6.25,2.38,2.38,0.60,4.46,9.52,3.57,5.36,0.00,0.89,2.68,9.23,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.30,20.24,4.17,1.79,2.98,5.95,3.27,4.17,1.49,0.00,0.00,0.60,5.06,0.30,4.76,0.00,0.00,6.55,1.79,2.38,1.19,0.89,0.89,0.89,12.80,1.19,8.93,0.30,4.46,3.87,0.60,0.30,0.00,0.89,0.30,1.19,0.30,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.30,0.00,8.93,5.06,2.08,0.00,0.00,0.30,0.00,0.60,0.00,0.89,0.00,0.00

t3_3dsku2,"caveat: not a republican, but i came from the right. i'll number the issues to keep track: 1. obamacare evil & no universal healthcare 2. deport all illegals 3. stayed at war longer in middle east 4. wealth inequality not an issue 5. poor people are poor because they are lazy 6. welfare cut or ended 7. no gay marriage 8. black people to blame for police brutality 9. climate change not real 10. corporations should not be regulated 11. mw kept below poverty line 12. marijuana kept illegal so, this is a big list - i will defend the first three: 1. health care is a huge topic. it consumes just under 1/5th of our national economy and it is a multi-faceted problem with many possible solution sets. republicans do not have a unified idea of what it should look like (neither do democrats), but the broad strokes are these: health care would function best as a market if the people directly paying for it were the people consuming it. the idea is that people care most about the quality and price of things that they pay directly for. witness the market for food - there are many many suppliers of food at an incredible array of price and quality points. everyone can find something that appeals to their price and quality preferences. prices are listed up front and people can shop based on price. quality is known from reviews like yelp or urbanspoon. this mechanism is largely absent from healthcare and conservatives would like to change healthcare to function more like this. conservatives would like to see the delivery of health care reformed drastically and they feel ripped off as well, but they just think that the aca was the wrong way to improve. this is the basic idea, and many things can be added to the scheme like help for those that can't afford it. 2. first, i would want to soften the description of this a bit. there are some who would deport all illegal immigrants (ii, from here on). most republicans wouldn't. it is a simple explanation really. we (the entire country, through our representatives) have made it illegal to enter the country without getting permission. ii's first act upon entry of the country is to break our laws. every day they are here they are breaking our laws. i may disagree with immigration law, but that's the law and the way to fix this is to change the law, not to ignore it. ignoring the law leads to mentality that it is ok to just ignore the law. this leads to pretty dark places. 3. i am not sure how nuanced the position of most republicans is on the middle east. there is so much misinformation regarding that area (bush's sotu speech, for starters) that it is tough to know the genesis of the average rep's opinion on the matter. i would say the average rep thinks that there is vague tie to 9/11 in there and that we are trying to topple regimes and kill people that want to kill us. they see the rise of is following the drawdown of troops in iraq and think that if we would stayed, is wouldn't have taken over syria and north/west iraq. it is a messy situation over there.",ct8ccm2,365.35579207150107,0,1437282575,93,15,-15497,0,71.98695482866044,535.0,771.0,42.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.09523809523809523,0.38095238095238093,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47619047619047616,0.0629991959260252,0.2841121495327103,0.0,0,0.0,555,74.34,47.12,14.97,13.56,13.21,16.76,81.44,50.09,11.35,4.14,1.26,1.44,0.00,0.00,1.44,7.21,7.57,12.79,9.91,3.06,4.86,2.52,15.68,4.86,2.70,0.54,3.96,3.42,5.77,2.34,3.24,0.00,0.90,0.00,5.23,0.18,0.00,0.00,0.00,13.51,2.34,1.80,3.06,2.70,1.44,3.60,1.62,0.90,0.36,0.36,1.26,0.00,0.72,0.18,0.36,8.83,1.98,1.80,4.68,0.72,0.54,2.16,10.81,0.54,10.63,2.16,7.75,1.08,3.60,0.36,0.00,2.70,0.00,0.54,0.36,0.00,0.00,0.18,0.18,0.00,14.59,7.57,2.16,0.72,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.54,0.00,1.44,1.44,0.72

t3_3e76cv,"i would start with a fairly generally point: 'music' is an umbrella term, and generally with words like this (like 'art', for instance), the definitions follow usage, not the other way around, so in a sense '*x* is not music' is a bit of an intellectually fruitless argument, especially when compared to an argument like 'x is not good music' or 'x is better as poetry than as music'. but beyond this: i'd like to make a pretty clear distinction here. *hip hop* is a genre of music that often involves *rapping*, which is an activity. because the two are so closely related, it is often acceptable to call (some) hip hop 'rap', but 'rap' is not really a genre in itself. now, plenty of hip hop has elements that are not spoken. so, when you say something like: > rap is always spoken what you are saying is unclear, since you could be saying something similar to 'singing is not music', which is depending on how you look at it either absurd, since all singing is musical, or makes sense since *mere* singing can be isolated from the broader idea of 'music' in the same way running can be divorced from athletics. if you mean the genre hip hop, though, you are next statement > the artists do not sing words is simply incorrect in many instances, and your view would be more specific than simply 'rap is not music' secondly, > it is like rhythmic talking is this really any different to singing? how is this distinct? singing is really just 'tuneful talking'. > also, it is not usually done with instruments besides drums, save for a few riffs on the chorus. the instruments are just for the rapper to stay on beat, not to be pleasing to the ear. this bit is objectively wrong, *most* rap has instrumentation besides drums outside the hook, even very minimal rap, and it is always there for the listeners benefit more so than the rappers (otherwise it would be edited out, surely). > thirdly, rapping is mostly about the story- like narrative poetry. music can be about a story, but usually is about emotions like love. there's two problems here. one is that not all poetry is about story, which you recognise since you singled out 'narrative poetry', but this does not really mean much since it is the same as going 'poetry is actually music because it has a story, like pop ballads'. secondly, plenty of rap does not have a story. > lastly, a lot of good rap reads just like poetry this is also true of plenty of songs, though, and the qualifier 'good' is strange. undoubtedly, what makes a good rap song does not necessarily make a good poem and vice versa. the word 'good' here just seems to try to unfairly take hip hop that does not fit your view, because it is not like poetry, and label it 'bad'. > the stanzas, rhythms, and imagery are just like more ""traditional"" poems. i'm not really sure this is correct. the format and rhyme schemes in rap are much simpler and much more rhythmic, rely more heavily on half rhymes and internal rhymes and are much more intertextual than 'traditional' poetry, and the imagery is usually more straightforward, or more centred on the language itself than the imagery it creates.",ctc45ny,801.8127171722491,0,1437578601,50,9,1099,0,58.59380200187678,556.0,813.0,23.0,9,0.17391304347826086,0.043478260869565216,0.17391304347826086,0.34782608695652173,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.13043478260869565,0.08695652173913043,0.21739130434782608,0.043478260869565216,0.043478260869565216,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.0,1.3478260869565217,NaN,0.21762589928057555,0.0,0,0.0,561,55.06,34.07,36.27,62.94,24.39,17.47,88.59,55.08,8.20,2.32,0.53,0.00,1.78,0.00,0.00,5.88,7.13,13.19,12.30,8.56,6.95,3.03,16.93,6.24,6.77,1.60,0.71,4.63,4.63,3.21,1.25,0.00,0.36,0.18,5.53,0.18,0.00,0.00,0.00,19.25,1.78,2.85,1.43,4.28,2.67,7.84,7.84,1.25,6.06,0.00,1.43,1.07,0.00,0.00,0.18,3.03,0.36,0.71,0.18,1.60,0.53,0.53,14.26,0.18,10.16,1.60,4.46,4.28,0.36,7.13,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,23.53,3.74,7.66,0.53,0.00,0.36,0.00,0.18,0.36,6.60,1.07,3.03

t3_3hh46c,"secularism is not really a bad view, but you do have some strange reasons for coming to secularism as a conclusion. i'd agree that if there were a hypothetical world where it was literally impossible to commit crimes, the laws defining those crimes would be pretty pointless. to take an example from our world, suppose your city had a law saying that exceeding the speed of light carries a fine of $2000 and a minimum 2 month jail sentence. this would be a silly and pointless law. (legal law, obviously c is a natural law of some sort.) however, reasoning given by religions, as i understand it, is that their theological laws are important not because they are not already covered by what is possible in nature, but for other reasons. like the action itself is bad for other people, or would displease a deity. additionally most religions define themselves by more than their prohibitions. if they had no reason for those rules (like a rule for sobriety, and then all the alcohol is destroyed), then the religion would still be fine. it wouldn't cause their god to suddenly cease to exist or something. even if the world were changed so that followers were incapable of displeasing their deity, it wouldn't mean that worship would have to stop. here are some much simpler reasons to believe in secularism: * we do not know how to judge objectively if one religion is more right than another. * we do not know if a god or gods exist. if the reason for doing something is ""god commands it"" then we can't be sure whether a command was issued in the first place. * even if we did know a command was issued by god, we do not know whether following that command will be better or worse than the current situation without cross examining it with other moral reasoning.",cu7bdxt,191.52155711579337,0,1439926047,40,10,1332,0,60.99223076923079,312.0,460.0,15.0,5,0.0,0.0,0.26666666666666666,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26666666666666666,0.0,0.8666666666666667,0.15329313543599257,0.22756410256410256,0.0,0,0.0,314,42.22,28.33,43.80,49.48,20.93,21.66,90.13,57.32,12.74,5.41,0.64,1.91,0.64,0.00,2.23,7.32,7.32,11.15,13.06,3.82,8.60,3.50,18.15,6.37,4.14,1.59,1.27,2.87,4.46,2.87,1.59,0.00,0.32,0.00,5.73,0.00,0.32,0.00,0.00,24.20,5.73,3.50,4.78,7.01,1.27,9.87,0.96,0.64,0.32,0.00,0.32,0.00,0.32,0.00,0.32,11.46,1.91,0.96,7.01,0.64,1.59,3.82,11.78,1.59,8.60,1.59,3.18,3.82,2.23,0.32,0.00,0.00,3.50,0.00,0.32,0.00,0.00,0.32,0.00,0.00,13.69,4.78,4.14,0.32,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.64,1.27,1.27,1.27

t3_2zi3o2,"i am an american too, and i grew up on traditional american sports like you did. i think a lot of liking sports is just a matter of taste, and some of that cannot be overcome. however, lots of sports is about other things. sports are also about connecting with other fans and connecting with your team, being part of a moment, etc... there are all sorts of sports that i do not really follow and wouldn't watch on my tv by myself, but absolutely love watching in person with other people. if you want to like soccer, the best way to get into it is to watch it with other fans. that having been said, i have a few comments about your specific points. > no hands every sport has weird restrictions, that's what makes them exciting. imagine what basketball players could do if they didn't have to dribble? imagine what football would be like if you could throw the ball in any direction at any time? overcoming the restrictions of the game to do something exceptional is what makes sports exciting and inspires creativity. > ball control soccer is more like hockey than any other sport in this aspect. yeah, there are possession changes, but every soccer coach drills it into you that you need to keep possession. that's what the best teams in the world do, and that's a large part of what makes them so good. when you have the ball, you can score, and your opponent can't. there is a huge correlation between keep possession and winning games, that's why fc barcelona and the spanish national team were so good for so long. [here](is an article about the relationship between possession and winning in major league soccer. like in every other sport, there are a variety of strategies, but generally speaking, more possession equals more wins. > low scoring games this is perhaps the biggest complaint about soccer by american fans, but i think it is one of the best thing about the game for two reasons. first, the lower the scores, the more likely that it will be a close game. in the nfl and nba, it is not uncommon for a game to be completely out of reach for the trailing team when the game goes into the last five or ten minutes. sure, when you are down 21 in football or basketball, you *could* come back to win, but you are not one or two good plays away from getting back in the game. in soccer, if the score is 0-0 or 1-0 as the game winds down, the trailing team is always one play away from completely turning the game on its head. this relates to the second point: every goal matters. in the nfl and nba, there are lots of scores, but most of them do not have an impact on the outcome of the game. any one basket in the scheme of a basketball game is basically meaningless. a single goal in a soccer game is hugely important, which makes the buildup to a goal more exciting. when a player shoots the ball, whether he ends up scoring, missing the goal, or having his shot saved, you know you are watching what could be a pivotal moment in the game, whether it is in the 8th minute or 88th minute. the most important play in a basketball game rarely (if ever) happens in the first quarter. anyway, food for thought.",cpj94l8,1755.9682509768802,0,1426720183,39,12,9111,0,70.26500724637681,575.0,796.0,30.0,14,0.03333333333333333,0.0,0.23333333333333334,0.36666666666666664,0.0,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7666666666666666,0.09819165508820685,0.20347826086956522,0.0,0,0.0,580,71.41,58.85,35.64,83.85,19.33,15.00,90.52,56.21,11.38,5.00,1.38,0.00,2.59,0.34,0.69,6.38,9.48,14.31,10.17,6.21,7.07,1.55,15.00,4.48,3.45,2.59,3.10,4.48,5.00,4.14,0.86,0.00,0.00,0.52,8.62,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.34,15.52,1.90,1.72,2.24,4.48,2.07,6.03,1.38,0.69,0.34,0.17,0.86,0.34,0.00,0.00,0.34,11.72,4.14,3.79,3.45,4.31,0.00,1.03,11.55,0.17,12.07,1.03,8.10,3.28,1.55,8.97,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.52,0.00,0.00,0.34,0.00,0.17,15.17,5.17,6.21,0.17,0.00,0.34,0.00,0.34,0.00,1.21,0.52,1.21

[...] but 97% of climate scientists agree! well, 97% of the ones who can get published do. why do you assume that the scientific consensus is driven by politics, and not that the politics is driven by scientific consensus? in the 70's, for a time, there was concern over [global cooling](worrying that various things we were doing would reflect more of the suns rays away from us, etc. despite the 70s being the highest rate of publication of ""global cooling"", there were always more papers that survived peer-scrutiny indicating warming than cooling. so we had two, contrary theories, and the one was shot down fairly substantially. is this not similar to what you would have expected of heliocentric and geocentric models of the solar system? and wouldn't you expect there to be substantial political support for publication of heliocentric models? sure, *now* the ratio is 97%, but back in 1967, it was only 67% (2:1 warming). from there, the papers continued the trended towards warming. then, in 1971, there were multiple papers supporting the cooling hypothesis, bringing it down from 86% warming down to only 64%. ...but then it *resumed* the trend towards 100%, and has generally continued in that direction ever since. the best it ever reached was only slightly better than 2:1 in favor of warming being the reality. do you honestly believe that there is some grand conspiracy dating back to when there were only something like 11 papers published *total* on the topic of climate change? if there were such a conspiracy, why have not changes been enacted already? > change a few assumptions about those feedback loops (e.g. how much sunlight is reflected back by cloud cover) and suddenly the predictions for warming are moderate and not catastrophic at all. on the contrary, changing the albedo level of the planet, through clouds (as is expected with global warming [see: venus]) does not change the catastrophic impact of co2 on our world & ecosystem. greater concentrations of co2 and greater temperatures have significantly detrimental impacts on [sea life](and since so much oxygen conversion takes place in the ocean, that does, in fact, have a fairly significant chance of reaching an effective point of no-return. and that's to say nothing of the aquatic ecosystem, and the impact it has on the ecosystem overall.",crueg2j,1514.1279651226619,0,1433358569,525,60,15479,0,53.73498568702291,393.0,634.0,24.0,8,0.0,0.0,0.16666666666666666,0.6666666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.0,0.041666666666666664,0.0,0.08333333333333333,0.0,0.9999999999999999,0.06430453604366647,0.2544529262086514,0.0,0,0.0,412,73.64,46.12,29.21,96.20,20.60,25.49,80.10,53.88,7.28,2.18,0.24,0.97,0.97,0.00,0.00,5.10,7.52,14.81,10.68,7.77,5.83,2.43,14.81,4.61,3.16,1.46,4.13,2.43,5.34,5.10,0.24,0.24,0.00,0.00,3.16,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,13.83,1.94,2.91,1.94,2.91,1.94,3.40,3.64,0.49,0.24,2.91,0.24,0.00,0.24,0.00,0.00,5.83,1.46,1.21,2.43,0.97,0.49,3.16,8.01,1.70,14.08,1.94,8.25,4.61,3.88,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.24,0.00,0.49,0.00,0.00,0.24,0.24,0.00,22.57,5.34,5.58,0.73,0.00,1.21,0.24,0.49,0.49,0.73,1.94,5.83

(2) most of us, most of the time do not have an alibi. we are just on reddit or sleeping or watching a movie. if anyone can accuse another of something, it is not a matter of *if* a charge will stick, only *when*. i cannot prove to anyone else right now that i am on reddit rather than out raping people. bots can be written to post/respond to threads. it is just not valuable as evidence. if i had to fight for my own life based on tonight's events, i would lose and you would too.",csl370t,345.57361240701545,0,1435489450,60,20,12299,0,75.00692108491211,319.0,444.0,23.0,32,0.13043478260869565,0.0,0.17391304347826086,0.043478260869565216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.0,0.0,0.3913043478260869,0.04960317460317461,0.2664576802507837,0.0,0,0.0,323,38.01,27.83,40.15,1.00,14.04,12.38,87.93,59.13,13.00,5.57,1.86,1.24,1.24,0.00,1.24,7.43,5.57,13.62,12.38,7.12,7.12,4.33,16.72,6.19,3.72,0.93,0.93,4.02,8.05,0.93,6.81,0.00,5.26,0.31,6.50,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,19.50,1.86,1.55,4.33,5.57,2.17,8.67,0.31,0.31,0.00,0.00,4.64,0.31,0.93,3.10,0.31,6.81,1.55,0.31,3.10,0.93,1.24,1.24,12.69,0.93,11.46,2.17,5.88,4.33,1.86,0.93,0.00,0.31,0.00,0.62,0.62,0.00,0.62,0.00,0.00,0.00,16.10,6.81,4.02,0.00,0.00,0.93,0.00,0.31,0.00,0.31,1.24,2.48

t3_3g1pcd,"let us interpret freedom of speech in a slightly different way. the first amendment states, >congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. the key words are ""shall make no law"" and ""abridging the freedom of speech"". what this means is that congress cannot outright ban free speech. it does not mean that congress must provide a voice for everyone who chooses to speak freely; those who wish to do so must still provide their own support. in addition to this, when others show the perpetrator the door, they too are exercising their right of free speech. the others are saying, ""i do not care about what you want to say."" if the government removes this, is not it denying others the right to their free speech? every extreme reaction is legal and valid because all participants are expressing their right to free speech. by forcing one to accept the perpetrator's ideas, one is inherently denied their personal right. this is why the xkcd comic makes sense, and is why people should be allowed to ignore others if the former does not like what others say. could you clarify your first point by explaining how those other acts are related to free speech?",ctu0izl,1109.2852383389782,0,1438897110,73,17,1124,0,64.92250000000003,240.0,345.0,12.0,3,0.08333333333333333,0.0,0.08333333333333333,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41666666666666663,0.08346702317290554,0.24166666666666667,0.0,0,0.0,239,65.12,61.53,16.11,98.06,19.92,21.34,89.54,53.14,13.81,4.60,0.42,0.42,1.26,0.00,2.51,9.21,8.79,11.30,9.62,3.35,5.86,2.51,17.15,4.60,0.84,3.77,1.67,0.84,7.53,6.28,0.84,0.00,0.00,0.42,11.30,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,18.83,4.18,3.77,3.35,2.51,2.09,7.11,6.69,0.42,5.44,0.42,1.26,0.00,0.84,0.00,0.42,5.86,0.42,0.84,4.60,0.00,0.00,0.84,12.55,1.26,6.69,0.42,4.18,2.09,3.35,1.67,0.42,2.51,0.42,0.42,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,13.81,4.18,4.18,0.00,1.26,0.84,0.00,0.00,2.51,0.42,0.00,0.42

[link](this is a study that only covers the united states. it can be extrapolated that the cost worldwide is many times bigger. this is only one disease out of many that may be influenced by biodiversity. and disease is only one aspect of the influence a greater biodiversity has on nature, and human beings. the costs of conserving biodiversity are simply far smaller than dealing with the consequences of not conserving it.",crdn176,53.23929191940987,0,1432005391,36,11,-23676,0,48.84863323500494,226.0,388.0,18.0,3,0.05555555555555555,0.0,0.0,0.16666666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.0,0.2777777777777778,0.12303921568627452,0.3495575221238938,0.0,0,0.0,237,93.23,53.38,18.46,14.18,15.80,27.85,76.79,42.19,6.75,1.27,0.42,0.00,0.42,0.00,0.42,5.49,8.02,13.50,7.17,3.80,2.95,0.42,9.28,4.64,2.53,0.84,5.49,2.11,4.22,1.69,2.53,0.00,0.00,0.84,2.53,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,10.97,2.53,3.38,1.27,2.11,0.84,1.27,0.84,0.42,0.00,0.42,7.59,0.00,7.59,0.00,0.00,5.06,0.00,0.84,2.95,0.00,2.11,0.84,7.59,0.84,12.66,2.95,6.33,3.38,3.38,0.00,0.00,2.95,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,18.14,6.75,5.06,0.00,0.00,0.42,0.00,0.42,0.00,0.00,1.69,3.80

t3_375cgq,"if we consider pure pragmatics and the wellbeing of the child, this is not effective. the desired behaviour is the child receiving proper nutrition and nutrition related modelling behaviour. the biggest barrier is parent behaviour and poverty: working poverty, fiscal poverty, generational poverty, knowledge, and habit. criminalizing a behaviour is not as strong a deterrent as many people think (consider marijuana, piracy, and jaywalking). charging the parents will not change their behaviours or make them more able to care for their children properly. along with perhaps lacking motivation (this is arguable), these parents are often deeply lacking in skills, resources, money, and time. charging them may strip them of even more money, community resource, and time. charging parent for a younger child's weight also promotes child abuse via crash diets and laxatives, and rewards parents whose children may be malnourished but thin. charging a parent for a school aged or older child brings into question the responsibility of the school as a nutritional provider and the child themselves. finally, i assume the outcome of an unpaid charge is jail or apprehension. removal of a child from parental care is extremely damaging and expensive, and can lead to generational repercussions. it is only 'worth it' if the alternative is severe abuse or neglect. while childhood obesity could be called a form of neglect, the potential impacts of widespread institutionalization of otherwise happy children would be devastating. to complicate things, there is strong evidence from a few recent studies that people do not know that their children are overweight (they literally do not see it). punishing people for something they do not even know is happening and may not be able to control will not change behaviour at all.",crju0u6,119.38650515646637,0,1432519822,58,11,1665,0,42.386095238095265,287.0,492.0,15.0,0,0.06666666666666667,0.06666666666666667,0.06666666666666667,0.13333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.06666666666666667,0.4666666666666667,0.11414220699934984,0.33797909407665505,0.0,0,0.0,287,64.42,67.46,40.20,15.89,19.13,31.36,90.59,48.08,7.67,3.83,0.35,0.35,0.00,0.00,3.14,3.83,7.67,9.41,9.76,3.14,9.06,2.79,14.63,5.23,3.14,0.35,0.00,1.74,6.27,2.79,3.48,0.35,1.39,1.05,13.24,2.44,0.00,0.00,0.00,18.12,4.53,2.79,2.44,5.57,1.05,5.92,0.70,0.35,0.00,0.35,2.79,0.00,2.44,0.00,1.39,14.98,3.14,3.14,7.67,1.05,1.05,0.35,10.80,2.09,11.15,4.18,2.44,4.88,4.18,0.35,0.00,2.79,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,14.98,5.23,6.27,0.35,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.05,2.09,0.00

t3_3cgwcw,"i have a couple different points to make, so this might not be very organized. but the context of when and how the discussion comes up matters. 1: imagine you have a dude who does not have a leg because he carelessly cut is off with a hacksaw. then you have an obese person who is too big to walk. they both go to a grocery store and there is one scooter. well the amputee can't walk because he has one leg. the obese person could just stop eating so much, and maybe wouldn't be so big if they would just walk. in fact, they probably should be walking. when people say obesity is not a disability, i think it usually comes up in a context like this, where people try to use obesity as a way of getting out of basic activities of daily living or to get special accomodations. people generally do not like the idea of someone getting special treatment because they are too lazy to walk, or do not have the self-control to maintain their health. it is kind of more like someone who complains about being thirsty, but will not drink water. 2: obesity can cause disabilities, but is not a disability in and of itself. again, people lose sympathy when it is something where people make a daily decision to stay that way. 3: sometimes people will blame their obesity on their health conditions, rather than their health conditions on their obesity. so when a person says they can't exercise because they have a bad back or bad knees or whatever else and that's why they are obese, the common sentiment is that ""no, you are not disabled, you are just fat. lose weight and you will not be 'disabled' anymore"".",csvi6d6,305.48116890078734,0,1436310578,65,9,5619,0,67.32723214285717,294.0,420.0,16.0,2,0.0625,0.0,0.25,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0625,0.0,0.75,0.05440115440115441,0.20068027210884354,0.0,0,0.0,297,21.28,63.18,42.50,6.80,18.56,18.86,92.26,60.27,12.79,7.07,0.67,0.00,1.68,0.67,4.04,5.72,6.73,9.76,12.12,9.43,9.76,4.04,19.53,5.05,2.02,4.04,1.68,1.35,4.38,1.35,3.03,0.00,0.34,0.67,13.80,0.00,0.67,0.00,0.67,17.85,1.35,3.70,2.02,5.39,0.34,7.41,1.01,0.00,0.67,0.34,8.08,1.68,5.05,0.00,5.05,5.39,0.34,1.35,1.68,1.01,1.68,0.34,15.82,1.68,13.13,3.03,6.06,4.38,0.34,0.67,0.00,0.34,0.00,0.00,0.67,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.34,0.00,13.80,5.39,4.38,1.01,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.34,0.67,2.02,0.00,0.00

t3_3g7ut4,">deep down the pleasure hunters feel when they have killed an animal does not make sense to me this is one of the most ancient desires. way back when, people only got to eat if they went out and hunted dinner. it was a basic survival instinct to want to track and kill an animal so you could eat it. while in modern times, it is no longer necessary, the instincts remain. some people make the decision to ignore instincts, and some fulfil them with other activities that have similar tasks involved. however, some people are more in touch with their baser instincts, and so they fulfill them with the task the instincts were designed for. personally, i have always found food to be more satisfying the more effort went into it. it does not make the food actually taste better, but the experience of eating the food is the culmination of whatever process you went through to acquire the food. taking the food through every step of the way from a creature in the wild to a meal on the plate is the maximum amount of effort that can go into a meal. each bite becomes a celebration of the achievement of what you have accomplished. also, in many cases (such as the deer you brought up), the ecosystem as a whole and the population of the species benefits from the hunt. in these cases, i exit the field not feeling bad that i killed an individual, but happy that i have stepped into a vital role in the ecosystem as an apex predator. at that moment, i cease to be an outside observer of nature and i have become a part of it. as i have a more in depth understanding of the results of my actions, i can actually provide a greater benefit than any other apex predator by carefully tailoring my hunts.",ctvqmlx,250.57247174048982,0,1439023957,32,11,-18209,0,61.040822784810146,316.0,459.0,14.0,40,0.07142857142857142,0.0,0.21428571428571427,0.07142857142857142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07142857142857142,0.0,0.0,0.07142857142857142,0.0,0.07142857142857142,0.0,0.5714285714285713,0.09579459002535926,0.25,0.0,0,0.0,316,91.51,43.71,51.35,49.32,22.57,17.72,87.66,56.33,12.03,6.65,3.48,0.00,1.27,0.00,1.90,5.38,12.97,16.14,7.28,3.48,6.33,1.27,12.34,6.33,4.43,1.27,0.32,4.75,4.43,2.85,1.58,0.00,0.95,0.00,5.70,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,11.08,2.53,1.27,1.27,1.90,0.95,3.80,1.90,0.00,0.00,0.95,4.11,0.00,0.32,0.00,3.80,6.65,0.32,2.85,1.27,2.85,0.95,2.53,9.49,0.00,12.66,2.53,7.28,3.16,1.90,0.32,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.95,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,9.81,4.43,4.43,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.63,0.32

t3_33fvr1,"one of your assumptions may be off - that about half the population is against the death penalty. one poll said support for the death penalty was at a historic low at 55%, but several others show support at ~65%. support for the death penalty does not mean all the others are categorically against it. in these polls, only about ~25% say that they are flat-out against it. so at this point, we are not excluding half of jurors, more like a quarter. of the remaining 75%, some may only be ok with the death penalty in extreme circumstances (an especially heinous crime) or if proof is overwhelming. they may be reluctant to apply it otherwise. life in prison is still a fairly stiff penalty so death penalty advocates are not necessarily ""harsher"" about punishing someone. they may simply see it as a practical issue - why waste all that time and money to give someone a shitty life until they die of old age, rather than just getting it over with? they may in fact be more empathetic than the average person, they acutely feel the anger of the victim's families and can empathize with the need for punishment and closure. it requires no moral sacrifice or guilt for someone who is pro-death penalty, to apply a lesser sentence. they may in fact feel better about doing so. but for someone who is anti-death-penalty to vote in favor of it, requires them to do something they hate and will feel terrible about. it is more likely they simply will not do it, so by allowing such a person onto juries, you are effectively removing the death penalty from the table. if 25% of the pool is anti-death penalty, the odds of getting 12 people who are willing to apply the penalty is very low, about 3%. you would effectively be outlawing the death penalty nationwide except for a handful of people, and those people will be killed more due to bad luck than due to the nature of their crime.",cqkvq2n,507.1558831827068,0,1429720029,138,15,38981,0,57.344834337349425,332.0,504.0,16.0,2,0.1875,0.0625,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0625,0.125,0.0625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.1302934102934103,0.2469879518072289,0.0,0,0.0,344,78.21,58.06,17.56,4.79,21.50,19.19,86.34,56.69,11.63,4.36,0.00,0.29,0.87,0.00,3.20,7.27,7.85,17.44,10.47,6.10,5.23,1.45,14.83,4.94,2.91,1.16,3.49,2.91,6.40,2.03,4.07,0.87,1.74,0.87,9.01,0.29,0.00,0.00,0.00,16.57,2.62,1.16,1.45,5.81,2.03,6.40,2.33,0.58,0.58,1.16,1.16,0.29,0.87,0.00,0.00,5.81,1.16,0.29,2.62,1.45,0.58,0.58,10.76,2.62,7.85,0.29,5.23,2.33,0.58,0.58,0.29,0.29,0.58,3.49,0.58,0.29,0.00,0.29,0.00,0.00,14.53,4.36,4.07,0.00,0.00,0.29,0.00,2.03,0.58,0.29,0.58,2.33
t3_3emi0n,"business make decisions regarding the number of workers to hire or fire based necessity. increasing the minimum wage increases the cost of labor, an expense to a business, and business will do what they do with any other expense that increases to make those decisions. if expenses increase so much that the business loses money they will either raise their prices or try to reduce expenses which may or may not include layoffs. a business will not fire people unless it is necessary to do so and will not hire people unless it is required to do so. wages and salaries are a business expense. the minimum wage is the minimum expense for labor. the lowest price for anything is the minimum expense a business will have to obtain that item. if the lowest price for a gallon of milk is $3.00 then they lowest expense a baker will have for that item will be 3.00. if that price goes up a baked does not stop buying milk. their profits may be reduced or they can make decisions that reduce other expenses to compensate or they can raise prices. my point is that the minimum wage is the lowest price a company can pay for an hour of labor. this is an absolutely necessary regulation to have and enforce. because there will always be more people who need or want jobs than there are jobs available, businesses have every incentive to hire any person willing to work for less than a person already holding a position. if i say i will do the same work for $.50 less per hour that guy holding the job could be replaced. when a company can always hire someone at a lower wage they can reduce their expenses by replacing workers for cheaper ones. the idea that increased wage expense will automatically mean layoffs in nonsense and a myth that relies on the general population not viewing labor as an expense that is no different to a business than any other other expense. it also relies on the myth that companies make hiring and firing decisions that are altruistic in nature. business hire and fire based on the businesses needs and profitability. a raise in minimum wage is a raise in expenses and of course businesses are not going to raise expenses on their own. the threat to lay offs of the minimum wage increases is a way to keep expenses low. if minimum wage increases were going to wreak havoc on businesses and lead to unemployment how do you explain the shrinking unemployment rate in states that increase their minimum wage this year? california is an example for how unemployment has not need negatively effected by a rise in minimum wage.",ctgh5zx,175.88185508828278,0,1437897578,30,8,-11333,0,58.022219780219814,455.0,701.0,25.0,4,0.04,0.0,0.0,0.16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04,0.04,0.0,0.28,0.1556662087912088,0.18021978021978022,0.0,0,0.0,458,74.84,36.33,23.14,11.60,20.82,22.05,88.86,51.75,9.61,3.28,0.66,0.00,0.22,0.00,2.40,6.33,9.39,12.01,11.35,2.40,7.21,1.97,15.28,4.59,3.49,1.31,0.66,1.97,2.62,0.66,1.75,0.22,0.22,1.53,5.24,0.00,0.22,0.00,0.22,14.63,1.75,2.40,2.18,4.37,1.31,6.33,1.09,0.22,0.22,0.66,0.87,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.87,8.52,0.00,1.97,2.84,0.87,4.15,0.44,12.45,3.49,10.04,3.28,5.02,1.97,12.66,0.00,0.44,12.01,0.00,0.00,0.22,0.00,0.00,0.22,0.00,0.00,5.90,4.59,0.66,0.00,0.00,0.22,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.44

t3_3gl352,"here in australia we have irv (otherwise known as the alternative vote) for the lower house and stv for the upper house. yes irv fixes the spoiler problem and removes tactical voting on that account. but it does nothing for the disproportionate nature of the result. for example, the lib/nat coalition here got around 3x the number of (first preference) votes here as the greens, but got 90 seats vs 1 seat. 3x the votes 90x the number of seats. any party has 12% of the votes distributed across many electorates are still going to get nothing. same problem as fptp. as for stv, yeah it is better and more proportionate, but less representative, in that since there are 6 members per electorate (state) each member represents their entire state. nsw has a population of 7.5m so few would consider a senator for nsw their ""local member"". the more seats per electorate the larger and therefore less representative it is. however the fewer the seats the less proportionate it is as with irv above. (if for example you have 3 members then you have a 25% quota, which means many parties that might have a 20% support nationwide would still end up with far fewer than 20% of the seats). in short, i can't change your view on fptp being bogus, because it is. but hopefully i can change your view on irv (alternative vote) and perhaps stv. they are each better than fptp but especially in the case of irv, it is far from the solution you are looking for.",ctz5par,584.9256299681988,0,1439306917,159,16,7100,0,71.40902791501976,253.0,357.0,16.0,1,0.0,0.125,0.5625,0.5,0.0,0.0625,0.0,0.0625,0.0,0.125,0.0,0.0625,0.0625,0.0625,1.625,0.11574074074074074,0.21739130434782608,0.0,0,0.0,263,84.85,53.04,20.10,46.81,17.53,15.97,73.76,50.95,7.98,4.18,0.76,0.38,1.90,0.00,1.14,3.80,9.13,14.83,7.98,4.94,7.98,1.14,11.41,9.13,7.22,0.38,3.80,5.32,3.42,2.28,1.14,0.00,0.00,0.38,5.70,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,14.07,1.90,2.66,2.66,1.90,1.52,5.32,1.14,1.14,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,8.37,2.66,1.52,2.28,1.90,0.76,1.14,8.37,1.52,10.65,1.52,6.84,2.28,0.00,0.76,0.76,0.38,0.00,0.00,0.76,0.00,0.00,0.76,0.00,0.00,15.97,5.70,3.42,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.76,0.38,3.80,1.90

t3_32t7lc,"i think you have got this arse-backwards. it is shame. by sharing examples of bad behaviour you shame that individual, and the behaviour itself. yes, there is a self-congratulatory side to it as well - for you affirm how not-shameful you are, *and most critically*, invite the other person to be not-shameful with you. but i would say this aspect is intrinsically subordinate to the former goal of mocking, discouraging, and affirming social condemnation of the offending behaviour. framing this as a humblebrag really misconstrues the spirit of shaming. when someone engages in shaming, they are most often spurred by rage and indignation, not a desire to brag. that is, people share stuff like this hoping to be affirmed by public opinion (yes, you are right, that's wrong, he has crazy, you are sane), not as a ploy to increase their social standing/face (wow, look at all the creeptexts you get, you must be cool). that's not to say shaming is good, right, healthy, ethical, or whatever else. i just emphatically disagree that it is just humblebragging. it is a different animal entirely. as a final, fallback thrust for your delta, your view depends very much on creep-shaming perceived sexual misconduct. it falls apart when the exact same kind of behaviour is employed in non-sexual contexts. consider these: > telling people about the terrible corporate email you got or shitty tech support you recieved are subtle brags about getting customer support > telling people about the stupid customer you got or ridiculous support ticket you recieved are subtle brags about getting having a job in customer support again, i acknowledge that in some cases, it is true that some shaming has some extent of self-congratulation embedded within (/r/fatpeoplehate) for example. still it is not the focus, it is not essential, and it does not motivate the act. people who post on /r/fatpeoplehate are not just circlejerking about how skinny they all are - they hate fat people, want to shame fatness, hoping to punish obesity (more than any care or interest in improving social health).",cqeenee,239.83998786063074,0,1429202364,107,15,-22796,0,49.49548112170092,341.0,547.0,16.0,1,0.0625,0.0,0.125,0.125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0625,0.0,0.0625,0.0,0.0,0.4375,NaN,0.3196480938416422,0.0,0,0.0,350,52.24,75.37,13.15,21.39,21.88,23.14,85.71,49.14,14.57,6.86,1.14,0.00,4.29,0.29,1.14,7.71,5.14,11.71,8.86,5.43,5.14,2.57,16.00,7.14,3.43,1.71,0.00,3.14,11.14,5.43,5.71,1.43,2.29,0.29,12.57,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.29,14.29,1.43,1.14,1.71,4.86,2.00,5.71,1.71,0.57,0.57,0.29,2.29,1.14,0.86,0.57,0.57,7.43,1.43,0.86,2.29,2.57,0.57,1.14,12.29,0.57,8.00,2.00,4.00,2.00,2.29,0.29,0.00,0.86,0.29,0.00,2.29,0.57,0.57,0.86,0.29,0.00,20.86,4.57,8.00,0.29,0.00,0.00,0.00,2.57,0.00,0.57,2.29,2.57

(3) there almost certainly exist locations where the cost of installing kiosks is more expensive than just maintaining the same work crew. anyway i am probably preaching to the choir. i am confused by your last point, but employers would have to pay ***more*** to have a competitive wage. if they tried to cut wages and pay less, workers would choose simply not too work. would you work an extra 40 hours for $1 more a week? $2? $100? maybe it takes an extra $1000/month. that means at the very least i need to pay ""basic income"" + $1000 to attract labor. let us say i am a small business owner and i can't afford a kiosk for my business, i need people. those people are probably hit the hardest. before they make have paid $15,000/year per worker with unskilled labor. now all a sudden there is a basic income for $15,000. now i have to pay an extra $1000 a month and labor suddenly costs $27,000.",ctrzqi3,356.26748320842034,0,1438753507,73,14,3323,0,67.63632301577744,361.0,526.0,23.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.17391304347826086,0.4782608695652174,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.043478260869565216,0.0,0.7391304347826086,NaN,0.2880886426592798,0.0,0,0.0,381,60.44,48.95,12.76,34.91,17.32,16.01,85.56,50.39,8.92,5.51,2.89,1.05,1.05,0.00,0.52,3.41,6.56,11.02,11.29,7.09,5.51,1.57,16.27,6.04,3.15,1.05,6.04,3.15,3.15,1.84,1.31,0.26,0.26,0.26,5.77,0.26,0.52,0.00,0.26,13.65,1.57,2.36,3.15,2.89,1.84,3.67,1.05,0.00,0.52,0.52,1.05,0.00,0.26,0.00,0.79,8.40,1.31,4.20,3.67,0.52,0.00,1.05,13.91,2.62,9.19,0.79,3.15,4.99,11.02,0.26,0.00,5.25,0.26,0.00,0.26,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.26,19.16,5.51,2.36,0.00,0.00,0.79,0.00,0.79,0.52,0.26,3.15,5.77

""incorrect"" programs are frequently ""incorrect"" due to factors beyond the direct control of the programmers. programs are designed for mass distribution on a variety of platforms, and some of the variations between platforms or between conditions in which platforms are operating lead to problems. part of a programmer's job is to foresee those potential problems and either create workarounds for them or safeguards to prevent those problems from turning catastrophic. that's an engineering job.",crpauw0,481.8089233705061,0,1432939538,60,8,-22093,0,41.52452263558945,485.0,825.0,23.0,27,0.043478260869565216,0.043478260869565216,0.34782608695652173,0.21739130434782608,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.043478260869565216,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6956521739130435,0.12218993128084038,0.27628865979381445,0.0,0,0.0,488,87.93,46.72,19.22,40.51,21.22,31.76,77.87,47.54,7.99,2.05,0.20,0.41,1.02,0.00,0.41,5.94,10.25,12.30,6.56,2.25,7.38,2.46,8.81,4.71,2.87,1.43,0.20,2.25,3.28,2.05,1.23,0.00,0.00,0.00,7.17,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,18.85,2.25,3.69,1.84,5.12,1.23,6.76,2.05,2.05,0.00,0.00,0.20,0.00,0.20,0.00,0.00,6.97,1.23,1.43,1.84,1.02,1.64,0.82,7.38,1.23,8.40,1.02,5.33,2.05,5.12,0.00,0.00,0.41,0.00,0.00,0.20,0.00,0.00,0.20,0.00,0.00,18.65,4.51,7.17,0.00,0.00,0.20,0.00,0.41,3.28,1.23,0.20,1.64

t3_36cadv,"okay, so, i am a screenwriting/playwright student here, and i got together with a few screenwriter friends last night to discuss the problems with got's rape scene last night. in my opinion, firstly, there was nothing wrong with the rape happening. rape is a horrible thing but it is also a very real part of westeros life. however, the most offensive thing about this rape scene in my opinion is that, instead of staying on sansa's face with the camera, the end shot was a good ten second of reek crying. basically, what got did was it made the rape scene *not about the woman being raped*, but about reek/theon. a rape scene should be about the victim, and to deny our emotional connection to the victim makes her an object in the scene. that's not okay. to have sansa get raped to advanced reek's storyline is like her getting murderer to advance reek's storyline: in both situations, she is made into an object for the male role to rally his courage around. my point in my discussion was actually more on your side than others: i said that what will let us see whether this is offensive or not will come in the coming episode, whether got will show us how this affects sansa and the realities and harsh effects of rape, or whether it is kind of swept under the rug after a one-off use for shock-value. as far as the chances of that happening, i wouldn't hold your breath: got's track record with rape scenes is pretty fucking terrible. go revisit the jamie/cersei scene in season 4, episode 3. why is that rape there? does it really affect either of the characters in any visible way after that season? no, it is shock value. it would be like if someone was murdered for no reason in the chamber in that scene, for no plot advancement. you might say got is a bloody show, but every death advances the plot. that's good story telling. gratuitous death that does nothing to help the plot wouldn't be. and same with rape. so, i am not up in arms about got's most recent rape scene, but rape scenes do need to be handled carefully, and judging got's track record, it is not a jump to assume they are going to botch the handling of this in coming episodes.",crczq7b,750.7698429186094,0,1431965728,875,56,33287,0,68.77710443037977,395.0,551.0,20.0,2,0.05,0.0,0.3,0.3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7,0.07888198289860339,0.23291139240506328,0.0,0,0.0,401,71.09,35.41,33.56,1.00,20.05,15.96,86.53,53.87,11.47,4.99,2.24,0.75,0.75,1.00,0.25,6.48,7.98,14.71,10.22,4.99,5.74,2.99,17.21,4.49,3.24,1.75,1.50,2.24,10.47,2.00,8.48,0.25,4.74,0.25,5.99,0.00,0.25,1.00,0.50,12.72,0.75,2.49,1.75,3.24,0.75,5.49,2.74,1.00,0.50,0.25,4.99,1.00,0.25,3.74,0.00,6.98,1.50,1.00,2.00,2.99,0.75,3.24,8.73,1.75,12.72,2.74,6.98,3.24,0.50,0.00,0.25,0.00,0.00,1.00,1.00,0.50,0.00,0.50,0.00,0.00,15.96,4.49,5.74,0.75,0.00,0.50,0.00,0.50,0.00,2.74,0.00,1.25

t3_30oi71,"question: you seem to assume that we must have *either* a safety net *or* a basic income. but i think everyone party to this debate (whether they think the safety net is inherently good or bad) would accept that you can have *both* a basic income and a safety net at the same time, and that you do not need to put 100% of tax revenue into basic income to get much (or all) of the benefit. (this is where the leftist and left-libertarians usually part ways with the right-libertarians.) past this, some of the arguments you make in favor of traditional public services do not acknowledge that these are not transfer payments at all, but public goods. traditionally programs like snap have been defended in terms of the greater needs of the least advantaged, but this has never been the justification for bridge-building, tank battalions, middle schools, or public health campaigns. (to paraphrase france - the law, in its majesty, encourages both the rich and the poor to walk across bridges.) between these two points, i think all of the substantive differences between conditional payments and basic income that you raise in section iv disappear. can you rephrase any of these section-iv points so that (a) you are not defending public goods on grounds which have no connection to inequality (b) you are not defending the *existence* of the social safety net (rather than defending the status quo that 0% of transfer payments go to basic income)? next issue: > regarding the funding side, i oppose forgoing our progressive income tax system in favor of a flat tax. let's say i had a tax system where someone who make 43,000 pays no taxes, someone who makes 60,000 pays 1/6 of their income in taxes, someone who makes 100,000 pays 40% of their income in taxes, someone who makes 200,000 pays 55%... that sounds relatively progressive, right? except all i described as a $30,000 basic income with a 70% flat tax. the problem with your opposition is that a flat tax plus a basic income is the same as a progressive income tax. there is no difference, other than that poor people (as with the eitc) and people with no income (unlike the eitc) can actually go down to negative rates. or, if you really are opposed to the words ""basic income"" and ""flat tax"", you can just say that you want a highly progressive income tax that will go negative, with people with no income getting the largest ""negative tax""; if that way of phrasing it appeals to you, then great. (if you are opposed specifically to *having high-earners work more*, and you think all else equal the high-earners should take a break and relax, then that is a good reason to avoid a flat tax. but as far as having high-earners pay a greater or lesser proportion of their total incomes as tax, you can always make a tax flatter *and* more progressive by raising the basic income associated with it, if a society does offer a basic income.) do you accept these two points? because you wrote so much, i want to deal with the points that i think are simplest and least controversial first.

t3_3atkce,"1) budgetary concerns. maintaining a full-time paid department for an area that has a minimal amount of fires (under 10, for example) per year is a waste of taxpayer funds. unlike police officers, who can take a **proactive** role in law enforcement in addition to **reactive**, fire departments are almost entirely reactive. meaning if there is no fire, they are spending their shift at the fire house (possibly training or maintaining equipment, but more likely not). with volunteers, the city saves a great deal of money by not staffing a fire house 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. 2) training. though it may vary by state, in my state all volunteer fireman are required to have the same training and certifications as paid firemen. volunteers can be ""fired"" if they are not up to snuff, fail to respond to fire calls, and many other infractions paid fire fighters are subject to. while their professionalism may be lacking compared to their paid brethren, they can be just as capable. also keep in mind that, unlike some paid police and firemen who take the job simply for the money/prestige/power/etc or have no better options, volunteers reap none of those - they sign up typically because they want to help their community. 3) quality of life. bring a paid, full-time fireman is a serious commitment. they are often required to work long rotating shifts and may have to maintain residence at the firehouse. this, coupled with the stress of the job if particularly active, can be rough on home life, being able to spend time with a spouse or children. there can also be restrictions on personal conduct, appearance, and such. many are not willing to make that sacrifice. volunteer departments allow people to greatly lessen the impact. liken it to the national guard: full time military service places a great deal of stress on servicemembers and their families, but joining the ng allows them to still serve in a generally more relaxed environment, with less intrusion on their personal lives, and only have to respond when needed.",csfy07o,450.0319241328563,0,1435075461,257,59,11131,0,56.78160130718956,340.0,526.0,18.0,0,0.2222222222222222,0.0,0.16666666666666666,0.2777777777777778,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.05555555555555555,0.05555555555555555,0.05555555555555555,0.05555555555555555,0.05555555555555555,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.0,1.0555555555555556,0.040156786696579086,0.3352941176470588,0.0,0,0.0,351,83.55,54.54,13.00,21.40,19.50,22.79,83.19,47.86,6.84,3.99,0.28,0.00,0.00,0.00,3.70,2.85,7.12,14.25,8.26,4.56,6.55,1.99,12.25,5.70,2.28,0.85,1.71,2.85,3.99,1.42,1.71,0.57,0.28,0.28,7.98,0.57,0.00,0.00,0.00,11.97,0.28,1.71,1.71,5.13,1.14,4.56,2.28,0.28,0.00,1.99,0.85,0.00,0.85,0.00,0.00,8.83,1.42,1.42,4.56,1.71,0.85,1.99,9.97,0.85,10.83,0.57,6.55,3.70,5.13,0.57,1.42,3.42,0.28,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,18.23,5.13,6.27,0.28,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.85,0.57,0.00,1.99,3.13
t3_3atkce,"i start this by saying that i come from a line of volunteer firefighters stretching back 85 years and 5 generations. we are regulated. in pennsylvania we are strongly encouraged to take tests and get certifications in order to ensure that we are ready for the situations that we may encounter inside that burning building. i joined when i was 14 and from that point you are not allowed to do much, participate in training, study for tests to prepare for them when you turn 18 and can take them. now let us talk about my dad. my father is known and one of the single most respected firemen in our area. he was certified to teach the official training courses for the state. he does complex calculations on how much water is needed to put out a fire and what pressure is needed and how to pump the water out of the truck (rural area, no hydrants) in his head. he has also inspired other men to become a professional fire fighter and currently we have two friends serving horry county, sc. at this point i am often asked why he is not a professional fire fighter and here is why, our department only averages 100 calls a year if that. if you added the surrounding area you might get 500 and then you would have an area that is too big to manage effectively. our surrounding towns and departments all band together in this sense, when one gets called out we all get called for backup. if the state were to pay the salaries alone for the county i live in, it would be far too much compared to the cost of the training they want us to complete.",csfzazu,320.787365119776,0,1435077575,257,59,13245,0,64.65886639676116,285.0,404.0,13.0,0,0.07692307692307693,0.0,0.0,0.07692307692307693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07692307692307693,0.07692307692307693,0.0,0.3076923076923077,0.027430555555555555,0.2771929824561403,0.0,0,0.0,291,54.55,90.99,26.22,31.64,22.38,15.81,89.35,55.67,15.46,11.00,2.75,3.78,1.72,1.72,1.03,4.47,6.19,13.40,9.28,5.50,7.22,1.03,15.81,2.41,0.69,2.75,3.44,2.75,3.09,1.72,1.37,0.34,0.69,0.34,13.75,0.69,0.34,0.00,2.75,9.97,2.06,2.06,2.75,2.41,1.03,2.06,2.06,0.00,0.34,1.37,1.37,0.34,0.34,0.00,0.69,10.65,5.15,0.00,3.09,2.41,0.00,3.78,11.34,1.37,14.78,1.03,9.62,4.12,5.15,0.34,0.00,1.03,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,7.56,4.47,2.41,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.69,0.00

t3_31z0jc,"""communism"" is itself perhaps too broad a term to try parse any argument around, especially when you talk about it ""in practice."" various ""communist"" countries have all used divergent forms of communism that were sometimes just labels used to justify autocratic regimes. the khmer rouge is an often cited example of communism gone awry, but if you actually look at the politics and ideology behind the khmer rouge, you will see that khmer nationalism and anti-westernism had just as much impact (if not more) on its ideology as ""communism;"" which mostly took the form of maoism in cambodia. so there is more to a communist country than just communism, you are totally glossing over local factors that helped to create authoritarian governments. there have also been plenty of autocratic and authoritarian capitalist countries as well. south africa was very much pro-capitalist and anti-communist under apartheid. between 1965 and 1966 over 500,000 indonesians were killed ironically, in the name of purging communists from indonesia. russia's transition from an authoritarian communist country to an authoritarian capitalist country shows, sometimes it just is not about the economic system. yet we do not cite these countries as examples of how capitalism has failed miserably. you also can't just look at communism through the lens of ""communist"" countries. various communist political parties and politicians take part in governments all over the world. if you want to see an example of a successful communist ruled area, look at the indian state of kerala. it was ruled by a marxist political party from the 1950's until 2011, and it now has the highest hdi in all of india, on par with developed countries, and is often cited as an example of successful development in a developing country. it has levels of literacy, access to medical care, etc. all done while the state was ruled by a communist party.",cq6ebdv,343.03233096778905,0,1428579423,53,15,13402,0,39.45807600434313,307.0,532.0,15.0,0,0.13333333333333333,0.0,0.13333333333333333,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.0,0.8666666666666666,0.09698943680036118,0.254071661237785,0.0,0,0.0,316,84.97,74.70,22.44,49.32,21.07,26.90,79.11,49.68,6.01,2.22,0.00,0.32,1.90,0.00,0.00,3.80,7.28,16.77,6.65,8.54,7.59,1.27,11.39,5.70,3.48,0.95,1.90,4.11,3.80,2.53,1.27,0.32,0.63,0.63,8.86,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,9.49,0.32,1.58,1.27,3.48,1.90,3.16,1.90,1.90,0.00,0.00,0.32,0.00,0.32,0.00,0.00,13.61,6.01,3.16,5.06,1.58,0.32,4.11,7.91,0.32,14.24,0.32,10.76,3.16,4.43,0.95,0.00,0.32,0.00,0.32,0.32,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.32,0.00,14.87,4.75,4.11,0.00,0.32,0.00,0.00,0.95,3.16,0.95,0.63,0.00
t3_2uyc2l,"while i agree with most of the points you present, i really do not like the idea of encouraging teenagers. 1. **sex creates emotional bonds between people.** even if the school is encouraging casual sex, that does not mean there is not an emotional bond between people when they have sex. as discussed on another cmv, i think some people are meant for casual sex and some people aren't. and the people that are not could be emotionally damaged by having casual sex. 2. **sex requires maturity.** some people, whether they want it or not, are not ready. i think health classes should definitely destigmatise sex and make sure even teens from middle school understand that sex is a natural/normal thing. but some people at that age will still be immature about it. 3. **so much drama.** this is also partly to do with my point on maturity. if immature people are having sex and being super open about it, even you have to admit that there is going to be a lot of shaming and bullying (in today's culture). i could see a lot of these quotes going around schools: ""her vagina looks weird"" ""he lasted 2 seconds"" ""she has pepperoni tits"" ""he has a small penis"" ""she queefed omg how weird"" teenagers would spread so many rumours. when people understand that all body types are normal and are mature enough to use the sex to get to know themselves better without becoming emotionally attached or spread rumors or shame people that have decided not to have sex, then *maybe* i could support this. but otherwise most teenagers would be too judgemental or immature to do this. this is not to say i think teenagers should not have sex. if they feel they are ready that's great, and destigmatising it is the first step. but when the school system encourages them to have casual sex, it gets weird. these are some things i am going to write but am too lazy to make arguments for. what happens when teens do not have safe sex even when the school is encouraging it? this goes against what a lot of religions value. parents probably do not want their son/daughter having sex. would the school be sued if someone gets a permanent std after having sex because the school encouraged it and a condom broke or something similar? this could backfire and cause them to have less sex (ex: omg my weird teacher is telling me to have sex, sex must be really weird.) also would teachers telling students to have sex be sexual harassment? it seems like it is similar even if it is not.",cod6jiu,1816.7515452329487,0,1423240937,135,19,43264,0,71.64909090909092,440.0,623.0,29.0,0,0.10344827586206896,0.034482758620689655,0.1724137931034483,0.20689655172413793,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06896551724137931,0.0,0.06896551724137931,0.0,0.6551724137931035,0.15364229024943307,0.19772727272727272,0.0,0,0.0,445,18.97,43.75,13.50,46.47,17.12,15.96,92.36,55.06,13.26,5.84,2.47,0.00,0.45,1.12,1.80,7.42,4.04,8.99,14.61,6.29,8.76,2.92,22.47,5.84,2.25,2.02,1.12,3.60,7.87,4.04,2.92,0.22,0.45,0.22,10.79,0.67,0.00,0.90,0.67,18.88,3.15,1.57,4.04,5.84,0.90,7.19,0.90,0.45,0.22,0.22,6.52,0.90,0.67,5.84,0.00,5.84,1.35,1.12,2.25,1.12,0.22,0.67,16.85,1.12,6.74,1.12,2.02,3.60,2.92,1.12,0.00,0.00,0.22,0.00,1.12,0.22,0.45,0.22,0.00,0.00,16.63,5.84,2.25,0.45,0.00,0.67,0.00,0.00,2.25,0.67,0.90,3.60

t3_31m7ag,"the bad thing in this is the disrespect you have for your partner. first of all, if you define cheating as simply sleeping with someone other than your partner, then i will agree it is not always immoral. why? because there are people who are agreeably in non-monogamous relationships. ethical non-monogamy is a thing and sleeping with someone else does not always constitute ""breaking the rules"". since you seem to conflate sleeping with someone else and breaking the rules, i am not quite sure which one of those you would label as cheating when you consider those things to be separate. (some clarification needed) now as far as breaking the rules and lying, your view seems to be that since there is no apparent damage, it is not morally wrong to lie about it. well i would argue it is deceitful because you are taking away the right of your spouse to operate under all relevant assumptions. if you being monogamous is something that would be important to your spouse either in an emotional or rational way, it is immoral to keep that information away from them. if it is not, then there probably is not a reason to make that a rule of your relationship. if it is a rule, you both agreed to hold something important. the moral way around it is to change the rules, not break them because changing the rules means both partners have a say and breaking the rule and lying about it something that would constitute betrayal in most partnerships, including romantic ones.",cq2vsp6,155.24442543428765,0,1428328397,124,27,-18841,0,59.57025641025642,260.0,385.0,12.0,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5833333333333334,0.0,0.0,0.08333333333333333,0.08333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25,0.0,1.0,0.1608225108225108,0.19615384615384615,0.0,0,0.0,262,39.99,75.41,35.08,11.09,21.83,20.61,91.98,61.45,18.32,7.25,1.15,0.00,5.34,0.00,0.76,11.07,6.11,14.12,10.69,4.58,7.63,3.05,16.41,5.73,2.67,1.53,0.76,2.67,7.25,3.05,4.20,0.00,1.91,0.00,12.60,0.76,1.53,0.00,0.00,22.14,3.82,4.20,3.44,6.87,2.29,6.87,0.76,0.38,0.38,0.00,1.53,1.15,0.38,0.00,0.00,9.92,3.44,1.15,4.20,0.38,0.76,0.38,11.83,1.15,10.31,0.76,5.73,3.44,0.38,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.15,0.00,0.76,0.00,0.00,0.38,0.38,0.00,10.69,4.20,3.82,0.00,0.00,0.38,0.00,0.76,0.76,0.00,0.76,0.00

(btw seaworld is the [10th most visited amusement park in the us](so i think it is fair to say that systemic problems with them constitute systemic problems with zoos as a whole since they have a rather large stake in the matter.) however, zoo's can also be institutions for scientific, public, and conservational good. indeed, your view entails benefits pretty much elusively from that column. are those values totally incompatible with zoos as a business? not necessarily. therefore, if you are arguing only for the *possibility* of ethical zoos, then i think your view is fairly unassailable. however, i think a more pertinent debate would be whether the zoological marketplace currently incentivizes the ethical zoo keeping to a high enough degree. here i would say no. there needs to be real science informing our policies about which animals can be kept in captivity, which ones need conservation in captivity, and best practices for keeping animals in captivity. when the only thing informing those policies is profit margins and lax regulation i do not think we will see enough ethical treatment. therefor, you should change your view to be that, while zoos might not need to be abolished, a systemic change is needed to the way zoos operate.",ctv0jgz,319.4233754332511,0,1438972866,100,15,-17797,0,45.90764705882356,272.0,454.0,14.0,5,0.07142857142857142,0.07142857142857142,0.21428571428571427,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14285714285714285,0.0,1.0,0.040946798299739476,0.2977941176470588,0.0,0,0.0,275,62.61,64.21,5.94,31.99,19.64,25.82,78.55,51.64,10.55,6.18,1.82,1.09,2.55,0.00,0.73,4.36,7.64,12.36,9.82,6.91,6.91,1.82,14.91,4.00,2.91,1.45,0.00,3.27,5.45,2.91,2.55,0.00,0.73,0.36,7.64,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,16.36,2.55,1.82,4.00,4.00,1.82,4.00,3.27,2.18,0.73,0.00,0.73,0.00,0.73,0.00,0.00,6.91,1.09,0.73,2.91,1.45,1.45,1.09,12.73,1.09,7.27,1.09,4.00,2.18,5.09,0.36,0.00,1.45,0.00,0.00,1.45,0.00,0.73,0.73,0.00,0.00,18.18,4.36,5.45,0.00,0.00,0.73,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.09,1.45,5.09

t3_3ax7py,"okay, i am not directly trying to change your view op as i think it is quite a reasonable stand. however i think it is too much of an exception to not consider the presiding matters of the festival. i will just list them out and you can assess for yourself whether they should have a mitigating factor in people's outrage. 1) the yulin government has backtracked on its word following their distancing of the festival last year. even though there has been sort of a ban on the public slaughter of dogs, with yulin being a poor and rural region, it is quite difficult to enforce. it is important to note that dog is not really considered a mainstream delicacy in china anymore and the rest of china is just as pissed at yulin. 2) it wouldn't be as horrific, if they didn't make it an *annual celebration*. it sucks that animals must suffer and die to satiate human appetites especially man's best friend. there are still many countries in the world that eat dog, but do not achieve this level of outrage because they do not rub it in the faces of the anti-dog meat campaign by throwing a huge festival where they must slaughter thousands of dogs. 3) no matter how much you try and disprove it, dogs are different from the livestock which we source our meat from. etymologically, they serve a purpose of companionship and in older times have even served as hunting partners. nowadays they have been domesticated and become very tame and affectionate towards humans. it is probably why they are also affectionately called man's best friend. they are not readily bred for meat and it would be in poor taste to eat them. mandatory [image](that probably sums up this point. 4) there have been many reports that some of the dog meat sourced during the yulin festival are not at all from dog farms. literally, some dog hustlers are just snatching up strays and stealing pets from other people. aside from the ethical problems this may have with the complete disregard for our pets, this also raises some serious health concerns. dogs are not cultured and bred to the same health standards of livestock and they are not exactly known to be the cleanest animals in the world. with small, cramped cages in close proximity to one another, this is a significant health risk that warrants attention on its own. so yea, food for thought. just not dog for me.",csgtgv2,335.7817244954573,0,1435131160,585,54,-22751,0,63.286719367588944,414.0,609.0,22.0,0,0.09090909090909091,0.0,0.13636363636363635,0.3181818181818182,0.0,0.045454545454545456,0.09090909090909091,0.045454545454545456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7272727272727272,0.0450036075036075,0.2898550724637681,0.0,0,0.0,420,58.15,50.00,20.02,18.73,19.09,20.24,83.33,54.76,12.38,5.71,1.19,0.71,0.95,0.00,2.86,6.67,6.43,13.57,10.24,5.71,6.19,3.10,14.05,3.57,2.38,1.19,1.43,2.14,5.24,2.38,2.86,0.24,0.95,0.24,7.86,0.00,0.95,0.00,0.48,14.29,2.14,2.38,1.67,2.86,1.67,4.76,0.95,0.48,0.00,0.24,3.57,0.48,0.95,0.00,2.14,6.43,1.90,1.67,2.62,0.95,0.71,1.43,10.24,0.48,9.52,0.48,7.14,1.90,0.71,1.43,0.71,0.48,0.00,0.71,1.19,0.48,0.48,0.48,0.00,0.00,11.67,5.24,2.86,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.24,0.00,1.19,1.19,0.95

t3_36utu6,"you can't use the the fact that something is allowable online as justification for expecting people not to act negatively toward a behavior. especially when said behavior makes them feel uncomfortable. if a person or persons views being researched online as a violation of boundaries, you either need to respect it or establish that you do not respect their boundaries. while they might not be able to stop you, they certainly do not need to like or accept the behavior in a social context. one way displaying displeasure with such behavior is to refer to it as ""creeping"" and those doing it as being a ""creeper"". so another way to word your question is: ""do people have a right to be upset that i learned things about them i found they posted online?"" i say yes, why? because people have a right to their feelings, people establish social norms and boundaries and may be upset when someone violates it. first i much address: ""presumably was put there for exactly that purpose."" you presume to much, something posted on social media does not imply that the poster means for it be information observed, retained, and reported by every single person who could find access to it. it might not be secret, but it is not meant to be a conversation piece either. if i go to a coffee shop and have a personal conversation with a friend about my mother dying of cancer, it is not a secret conversation and people may over hear. however if someone, even an acquaintance, comes up to me a month later and starts a conversation with ""i heard you talking about your dying mom at starbucks last april."" i am going to find it off putting, and likely consider that person a creep. the online world seems to become a place where people tell themselves that if a door is unlocked they are allowed inside. if someone leaves a photo album open, they are allowed to open the book make copies of all the pictures and maybe using them in photoshop later. while legally, they are right with the second example, social norms in groups may have different rules. these rules can change from group to group and you do not have to agree to them to be held to them in the eyes of the group. another thing to consider is that people not only take issue with the action of being researched, they also take issue with and are made uncomfortable with idea of someone taking the time and effort to research them and see what is available about them online. they may not be able to stop said activity, but they certaintly do not need to treat it as an acceptable for of social interaction.",crhc46p,582.9447871337796,0,1432298658,187,48,11556,0,59.818095572354224,463.0,676.0,20.0,0,0.05,0.0,0.15,0.15,0.0,0.05,0.0,0.05,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.0,0.6499999999999999,0.05868838763575605,0.21382289416846653,0.0,0,0.0,462,55.35,75.58,49.97,37.25,23.10,16.88,92.86,57.58,15.15,8.01,1.95,0.00,1.95,0.00,4.11,7.14,6.93,14.07,9.96,3.68,7.79,3.03,18.83,3.46,2.16,1.30,0.87,3.03,3.46,1.95,1.30,0.87,0.43,0.00,15.80,0.43,0.43,0.43,0.00,19.26,4.98,3.03,2.16,5.19,1.52,5.84,2.81,1.30,1.08,0.43,0.65,0.22,0.22,0.00,0.22,7.58,3.25,1.08,1.95,0.87,0.43,2.38,12.99,1.73,10.39,2.60,4.76,3.03,1.73,0.65,0.43,0.22,0.00,0.43,0.43,0.00,0.00,0.43,0.00,0.00,10.82,3.90,3.68,0.43,0.00,0.43,0.00,0.00,2.16,0.22,0.00,0.00

t3_3fkcij,"the biggest issue with sticking by a percentage based system for reviews is that it fails to adequately consider that people interpret the review scale in different ways. for example on a four star system a 2/4 review generally means an average but passable movie, but you can't translate that directly to a percentage based system where anything below a 70% is generally considered completely unwatchable. yet that's what metacritic does, and it is why even movies that seem to have universally positive responses from critics end up with review scores that gravitate up or down based on ultimately nitpicky details. whether or not a movie is *enjoyable* is significantly more important than whether or not a movie you will somehow judge a movie to be a 90% or a 95%. the rotten tomatoes score gives you useful information about the odds of the former while the metacritic score is a rough, inaccurate estimate at the latter. i'd argue that metacritic scores are also less useful to people looking to find the ""best"" movies at a theater simply because these scores tend be horribly inflated even when a movie is bad. like i stated earlier, a 70% is often the benchmark for when a movie is even considered acceptable. this results in movie lists that are loaded with reviews hovering in this 60-80 range, often with numbers so close that it is difficult to pick out one particular movie over another. by forcing reviews into a binary system rotten tomatoes scores end up having significantly more variety in scores, while also ensuring every reviewer is abiding by the same basic benchmark. you either like a movie or you don't, there is no question about whether or not ""one thumb up"" is the same as ""two stars"" or ""50%"".",ctpgbdv,707.5112801452345,0,1438569931,15,6,-21290,0,36.879943298969096,291.0,483.0,10.0,0,0.2,0.0,0.3,0.3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.1,0.0,0.0,0.3,0.0,1.4000000000000001,0.1651845068511735,0.25773195876288657,0.0,0,0.0,300,78.75,34.44,52.22,25.77,30.00,22.67,82.67,53.00,8.33,2.33,0.67,0.00,1.67,0.00,0.00,6.00,9.67,14.00,8.00,7.33,7.33,2.00,12.67,7.33,5.67,2.67,4.33,3.33,4.67,2.33,2.33,0.33,0.33,0.33,3.33,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,15.67,3.33,2.67,0.00,5.00,1.33,6.33,1.33,0.33,0.00,0.33,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,7.67,0.00,1.00,4.00,3.00,1.00,0.67,9.67,0.33,11.00,0.33,7.00,3.67,2.67,4.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,12.67,3.33,2.33,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.33,2.67,1.33,0.00,2.67

t3_3ggp32,"> america can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. those bombs were dropped on cities full of innocent civilians, women and children. people with real lives, they were emotional sentient beings; not a statistical number. there had to be some other way than decimating two civilian cities just because we want to end a war quickly. firebombing was practiced by both the axis and the allies during ww2, caused more deaths than the atomic bombs, and often leveled civilian cities under the guise of attacking military production facilities. how is dropping an atomic bomb any worse? there were military targets in hiroshima and nagasaki as well. during a total war, no civilians are safe because any civilian could reasonably be justified as aiding the military. do you work in a factory that makes clothes, ammo, metals, food, etc for the war? you are no longer a civilian but a valid military target. this logic was commonplace throughout ww2. > if we observe the reasoning of us generals behind the nuclear bombing to end world war 2, we can see some parallels. al-qaeda and american generals both used a method of causing mass casualties to drive a point across. they both used lives of innocent civilians as a statistic to further their respective causes. the atomic bombings caused 246,000+ casualties (not taking into account the deaths caused later by radiation exposure and cancer. 9/11 caused 3000 deaths. this comparison is not really worth a response. how do you compare two nations who are at total war with each other to a guerrilla terrorist group attacking a country that is not at war? >civilians vs army: if you believe that the ends justify the means, then dropping the bomb may seem justified. but then you also agree that civilian casualties are fair game to drive a point across. army is a different thing. a soldier agrees to the dangers of war and hardship for the protection of their nation. they agree to the fact that they may not return alive from a war. a civilian is a different case, their involvement in a war is very remote. to slaughter innocent civilians just because it will hasten the end of a war seems unjustified. many people hold the viewpoint that the us bombing was in retaliation of pearl harbour. but the japanese attacked a naval base, they did not bomb a hospital or a school did they? if we agree that the end justify the means then logically we have to say that al-qaeda was kind of justified to cause 9/11 as well. again, in total war, civilians are not civilians. > the argument of usa that the bombing saved more lives compared to operation downfall, in the long term, is wrong. because at least the lives of innocent civilians would have been spared. how do we even know the outcome of operation downfall? moreover japan was nearly close to surrendering anyway as the secretary of war, henry louis stimson agreed: from the war journal of the imperial headquarters: ""we can no longer direct the war with any hope of success. the only course left is for japan's one hundred million people to sacrifice their lives by charging the enemy to make them lose the will to fight"" japan was prepared to fight to the last man woman and child, operation downfall saved millions of lives.",cty0cpf,2420.905443491707,0,1439223312,102,15,5617,0,56.14040513008047,563.0,891.0,34.0,0,0.08823529411764706,0.0,0.08823529411764706,0.17647058823529413,0.0,0.0,0.058823529411764705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029411764705882353,0.029411764705882353,0.11764705882352941,0.0,0.5882352941176471,0.040506799597708684,0.261101243339254,0.0,0,0.0,572,90.76,65.63,19.82,3.06,16.82,22.20,80.94,47.55,7.34,4.37,0.00,1.57,0.87,0.00,1.92,2.97,10.49,13.11,7.52,3.32,5.42,1.92,11.71,4.90,3.50,0.70,2.45,2.97,7.69,2.62,5.07,0.17,4.02,0.17,7.69,0.00,0.00,0.35,0.17,14.34,2.97,5.24,1.22,2.97,0.87,4.20,0.35,0.17,0.17,0.00,2.45,0.17,2.10,0.00,0.17,9.09,2.10,0.70,5.24,0.35,1.05,2.97,8.04,1.57,9.97,0.52,6.29,3.32,1.92,0.17,0.00,0.35,0.17,4.02,1.05,0.00,0.00,0.52,0.35,0.17,12.59,5.07,3.50,0.52,0.17,0.87,0.00,0.35,0.35,0.35,0.17,1.22

t3_37i8f6,"the issue here is that you believe that mothers currently have a right to choose whether or not they have a child, and that men should therefore be extended the same right as women. this argument is flawed because women do not have the right to choose whether or not they have a child. what they have is a right to exercise control over their bodies which translates into an ability to choose not to have a child. this ability is a natural consequence stemming from the right of a human being to exercise said control over their own body. meanwhile, children have the right to material support from their parents, who are responsible for bringing said child into existence, until such time as the child has the ability to secure material support for itself. so there are two right here: the right to exercise control over one's own body, and the right to be supported by one's parents until one has reached the age of majority. under the status quo of abortion rights existing, neither of these rights can legally be infringed upon. under your proposal, the child's rights would be infringed up, though the right to exercise control over one's own body would not be infringed upon.",crnhkad,547.5040953458005,0,1432810801,1974,33,22396,0,53.62051734449763,209.0,313.0,8.0,1,0.0,0.125,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25,0.0,1.375,0.1858756323042037,0.18660287081339713,0.0,0,0.0,209,82.94,70.08,37.81,52.71,26.12,22.01,88.52,57.89,8.61,3.83,0.00,0.00,0.96,0.00,2.87,4.78,10.05,16.75,12.44,3.83,6.22,2.87,14.83,2.39,1.91,2.39,0.96,0.48,2.39,1.91,0.48,0.00,0.48,0.00,12.44,1.44,0.00,1.44,0.48,11.96,1.91,3.35,1.44,0.96,0.00,5.26,0.96,0.00,0.96,0.00,4.31,1.91,2.39,0.48,0.00,12.92,0.96,1.44,9.57,0.00,0.96,1.44,12.44,0.00,13.40,0.48,10.05,2.87,0.96,1.91,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,10.05,3.83,3.83,0.48,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.91,0.00,0.00
t3_35peeu,"if you watched the evolution of, e.g. firefox over the last several years, you will have noticed a steady trend towards looking more and more like chrome. not just the ui either -- the actual dev tools in ff (which used to be quite different from chrome) have now changed to look almost exactly like chrome's. if other browsers have caught up or surpassed chrome, it is been based on the pioneering ideas that originally emerged from chrome. feature wise, there are probably as many features that work in chrome but not ff as there are that work in ff but not chrome at this point. it seems the core rendering and css stuff gets picked up a little quicker in ff, but many of the js api features and webgl stuff gets picked up a little quicker in chrome; either way, until at least both browsers adopt them, almost no mainstream developers are able to use such features since we typically have to support at least those two platforms. outside of the standard, chrome's dev tools have almost always had the coolest features first, like heap profiling and snapshotting, debugging within source-mapped minified js, or rendering dom updates interactively within the inspection tool. memory wise, both browsers are memory hogs; chrome's addons actually tend to be the biggest offenders in this regard, but i think the design philosophy is that 95% of users have pretty beefy machines with multiple gigabytes of physical memory, and most of what they are doing is just browsing the web, so it is not such a big deal (usually) to use lots of memory. it is also worth noting that chrome is fairly good at backgrounding tabs in such a way that much of that reported memory usage is actually paged out of physical memory, meaning it is not really hogging any important resources at all. one area where chrome was decidedly inferior for a long time was that they only shipped 32-bit builds, however they have since (as of last year) started building 64-bit binaries as well.

t3_3cemxp,"> these company's would now have to spend much more of their budget on paying employees, and it is not as if they are going to magically have more money. payroll expense is typically in the 20-30% range of a companies budget. most places (especially urban areas where the $15/hour is getting the most traction) are already paying above $7.25 minimum. the most likely scenario would be your payroll expenses going up 20-30% from their existing levels, so now you payroll is 25% of your expenses, instead of 20. a bit of a shock, but seeing as every wage hike plans to do it over the course of a few years, you can easily compensate for that increase with modest price increase to raise your revenues. > the first would be to decrease the amount of employees. if approximately an equal percentage of employees are let go to the increase in pay the company will be able to function without upper management having to take a pay cut. businesses are already operating with as few employee's as possible. rare is the actual charity case where somebody has a job for no reason. cutting your workforce would just hurt the business, since your productivity would very likely drop. > the other solution would be for the company to increase prices (for retail/restaurants). with increasing prices nobody would have to loose their job, however it would still end up hurting the lower class. no, because it is not going to be a straight 1 to 1 price hike. most likely it would be in the 10-20% range. so something that was $10, is now going to be $11 or $12. yes, that's more expensive than before. but when i was making $10 and now i am making $15, i just got a 50% raise in pay; i can afford that increase and i am still much better off. > as a minimum wage employee myself, would love to have a good reason to support raising it. realize that wages are just a portion of the expenses of running a business. they have to pay rent on the building, pay for utilities, insurance, raw materials, etc.",csuydx4,886.7321540153152,0,1436281073,65,13,-7269,0,66.08000000000004,345.0,506.0,21.0,13,0.0,0.0,0.2857142857142857,0.14285714285714285,0.0,0.047619047619047616,0.0,0.047619047619047616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5238095238095237,NaN,0.22608695652173913,0.0,0,0.0,364,75.17,48.90,21.22,30.41,18.20,18.96,88.19,54.40,9.34,4.95,1.65,0.00,1.92,0.00,1.37,4.40,8.24,15.11,12.64,5.77,4.95,1.65,16.21,6.87,4.67,0.82,5.22,4.67,3.02,1.65,1.37,0.00,0.00,0.82,4.40,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,12.36,1.10,2.20,3.30,4.12,0.55,3.30,1.10,0.27,0.00,0.82,0.82,0.00,0.27,0.00,0.27,7.14,0.27,1.37,3.30,1.37,1.10,1.37,10.99,1.65,13.46,4.12,5.22,4.12,8.79,1.10,0.27,9.62,0.00,0.00,0.27,0.00,0.00,0.27,0.00,0.00,17.86,5.49,4.40,0.00,0.27,0.00,0.00,0.82,0.00,0.82,1.10,4.95

t3_304nx9,"i am going to try to change your view not as to the existence of god, but as to your desire to believe in god. what does religion offer? why is it appealing if it could be accepted? i think the answer to that is that it provides a community of people, it provides a set of moral guidelines that help guide decision making, it provides an answer to the question of what living a good life means, and it provides an answer to what happens after we die. so... first you can have friends and community without religion. just because you do not go to church every week does not mean you cant get out there. join a bowling group, or whatever your personal interests are. i will bet that you are going to have more fun at a weekly laser tag meeting than at your weekly sunday service. second moral guidance can be found in a number of places. if you are interested there is a lot of philosophy on the topic but it does seem that we have an innate sense of fairness that can be extrapolated into a moral code. if i said ""do what you feel is right"" i do not think you would have any trouble knowing what you should do in any situation - and i think it would still be a challenge to actually abide by it. a good life: personally i think discovering what a good life means to you is the whole purpose of life. it takes time, it takes experimentation, but it is ultimately about self discovery and finding out what you want. this search in and of itself is valuable. besides i have met a lot of really miserable christians so its not like religion actually delivers on this front with any reliability. finally what happens after we die. what was it like before you were born? would it be so bad to go back to that? however regardless of what you believe what happens after we die will happen to you. the only thing you can do is to live your life. personally i always hate when i have to tell myself ""thins will get better next year"" so i could not imagine if i had to tell myself ""things will get better after i die"" and go through my life waiting for heaven.",cpp2cq4,170.36298156624667,0,1427209047,734,118,-23489,0,70.63772727272728,396.0,552.0,22.0,22,0.045454545454545456,0.0,0.22727272727272727,0.18181818181818182,0.0,0.0,0.045454545454545456,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.045454545454545456,0.045454545454545456,0.045454545454545456,0.6363636363636362,NaN,0.22727272727272727,0.0,0,0.0,396,38.06,69.32,58.07,68.66,18.00,15.15,94.44,61.62,19.70,9.85,4.04,1.01,4.80,0.00,0.00,9.85,5.30,14.39,12.12,4.80,5.81,2.02,22.47,3.79,3.28,3.54,0.51,2.27,4.55,3.28,1.01,0.25,0.25,0.25,10.61,0.00,0.25,0.00,0.00,17.42,6.06,1.26,3.54,3.54,0.51,5.30,1.26,0.51,0.25,0.25,2.02,0.00,2.02,0.00,0.00,8.08,3.03,1.52,0.76,3.03,0.51,2.02,18.69,1.52,10.35,1.77,3.79,5.05,0.76,0.51,0.00,0.25,2.78,1.01,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,9.85,5.05,1.77,0.25,0.00,1.01,0.00,0.25,1.52,0.00,0.00,0.00

t3_3k8c42,"i do not think i can change your main view, and frankly, i am not really exposed to the gaming community and what standards they set for games. i would like however, to try and change your view on a few of your more specific points. > 3) i will preorder whatever the fuck i want... while it is true that everything has been decided, you as a consumer were not yet shown, at the time of pre-order what all those things are. you are shown some fancy pre-rendered trailer that hardly shows any gameplay. you are unable to read/watch full reviews of the games because of embargos. you are essentially paying for a product, without significant information regarding the end product. consider buying a house that is yet unbuilt. while a house is certainly a much larger expense, it is fitting to take an example to the extreme to show the fault in logic. suppose a contractor was trying to sell you a house, but instead of showing you the exact plans of the house you are about to buy, and instead of allowing you to look through a graphic simulation of the end product, he would show you a video of a spaceship. you are not getting a spaceship, you are getting a house, but this spaceship is really fuckng beautiful! unless the pre-order has real advantages, such as a lower price, and some real in-game footage has been shown, why would you pre-order? wait for the game to come out. see someone else play it, decide then. in the age of downloadable games, they are not going to run out of copies. so just relax and wait for the embargo to be released, and watch the reviews. edit: also, other rewards for pre-orders, such as exclusive in-game content, is a big no-no in my opinion. they are incentivising you to buy a product that you have not seen with the fact you will never ever be able to get something unless you pay for something blind. this is no just whether you get %10 off for pre ordering, and if you do not want that risk, well, you just pay $6 more. you are either playing it safe and never getting something, or not playing safe. there is no fair option. > 4,) developers need to make money to survive i do not really know how this relates to your main view, but i would like to raise a point. just like any business, the risk should be on them, not you. you should not take the risk of a failing development, and if you do take the risk, you should be rewarded, and i am not talking about an extra skin, i am talking about monetary reward. just like an investor that puts $200,000 into a startup company and gets a percentage of the company's profits, so should you. if you take the risk, you should get, at the very least, your money back. for me, kickstarter should not be a pre-order platform with some fancy rewards, but rather a risk taking funding. where the basic premise would be that i pay for the game now, the money i gave goes for development. the first profit the company makes goes to pay back everyone that funded the game, and everyone that funded the game gets the game for free. and of course, they can cap the money they get from kickstarter, so to not give too many free games. >5) day one dlc i actually do not have any issue with day one dlc of game content. if instead of costing $60 with $10 dlc on the one for a few extra maps, it was $50 and $10 would you be ok with it? how about $40 and $20? $30 and $30? how about the main game was free, and the day one dlc with a couple of extra maps was $60, would you still dislike day one dlc? the problem is merely the price, and if you do not like the price, just do not fucking buy it. it is absurd to expect ""everything that was developed"" to be put into one product, because it was already developed. who cares if it was developed, or will be developed next week?

t3_3bx3hw,"i guess i will add my two cents here. like you said, gay people have fought for years and years for it to be ok to just 'be'. as a straight male, though i am sure you can certainly try to sympathize with what that might feel like, i doubt you can fully imagine. we have had to fight for the rights and acceptance to, literally, just walk down the street without (on the low level) feeling uncomfortable or (on the extreme level) being beaten up. yes, certainly, society has come a long way. i can walk down the street, dress how i want, wear my hair how i want, and even show affection to my gf without feeling uneasy, but it is taken me years to get to that point and many other lgbt people still do not get to feel good/normal about just being themselves walking about around town. so..having said all that, when we finally have safe space (again, this is not just safe as in somewhere i can go and not get beaten up, but somewhere i can go and feel ok to be who i am and not like people are staring at me judging me) it is kinda sucky to look around and see only straight people. this is not reverse discrimination. this is not 'we hate straight people, have a taste of your own medicine'. it is more, straight people can go anywhere and be surrounded by like-minded individuals. they can dress, act, display affection in a straight manner in literally any space and no one will batt an eye. so ya, we want our one space (gay bars/events) where we are the majority. we want that space where we can look around and see other gay people and feel like we belong. that's the whole point of having gay spaces. many people (myself included) are fine with straight people coming to our bars in certain circumstances (for example, you want to go and support some of your gay friends - awesome!). but otherwise, can't we just have this one thing? if it becomes common for straight people to enter into a particular gay bar (like the one you are talking about) then what makes it a gay bar anymore? how are we (lgbt people) supposed to feel like it is our space anymore when we look around and no longer have those feelings of 'everybody here has gone through a similar experience, we have all fought to accept ourselves and are here to celebrate it' ? i would never ask a straight person to leave a gay bar or purposefully try to make a straight person feel uncomfortable for being there...but if it did become common place for straight people to hang out at my favourite gay bar, i do think i would feel kind of like ""aw, this used to be such a fun space for gay people to hang out and meet and thats kind of ruined now"" i do not agree with the comments that you should not go to a gay bar because you might 'confuse gay men' or because we homos do not want to see your straight affection. i really think its just 'this is our one space to feel like we belong, you literally have every other space on the planet. please let us have this' as a last note, it is my personal hope that one day we will no longer have the need for gay space. one day, i hope, no lgbt person will ever feel uncomfortable being themselves in public. all space will be free space for everybody, gay straight whatever. but unfortunately i do not think we are there quite yet and until then i hope we can continue creating safe, fun spaces for everybody.",csqi22s,710.5007860924544,0,1435887949,412,43,11399,0,71.16888654477265,632.0,836.0,27.0,0,0.037037037037037035,0.037037037037037035,0.25925925925925924,0.4444444444444444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.037037037037037035,0.0,0.07407407407407407,0.037037037037037035,0.9629629629629628,0.10658401427632194,0.16772151898734178,0.0,0,0.0,635,29.52,72.51,78.95,61.61,26.46,13.39,96.54,57.95,16.85,10.39,4.25,3.62,1.89,0.16,0.47,6.14,3.94,13.07,11.50,6.77,7.09,2.83,21.10,7.56,2.52,1.73,1.26,1.89,7.09,4.41,2.52,0.94,1.10,0.31,12.28,0.00,0.47,0.16,0.47,16.06,3.15,1.57,2.36,3.94,2.05,4.57,4.09,1.57,0.31,1.89,4.09,0.31,0.16,2.36,1.26,8.35,4.88,1.10,1.26,0.94,0.63,1.73,17.48,2.05,16.38,2.36,10.39,3.31,0.00,1.57,0.00,0.31,0.00,0.00,1.57,0.16,0.63,0.94,0.00,0.00,14.80,4.09,4.72,0.00,0.00,0.47,0.16,0.31,0.31,1.89,2.52,0.31

t3_3i9n2q,"so with point 1 and 2, you have to think about context. the incident in point 1 has to be viewed in the context of women having been abused by their partners for centuries. sure, women might hit their partners too, and that's not nice, but men do it and have done it more. point 2 is the same. i totally see where you are coming from and logically what you are saying makes sense. but annoyingly it is not that simple. you have to look at it in historical context. women are raped more than men. women are in far more danger of being raped than men, all the time. with this in mind, the sexual harassment videos you watched probably knew this too. if you knew everyone in your class loved apples, you wouldn't bring an equal amount of apples and oranges to give out, just to be fair. that would be odd, because you have learnt from past events how the majority of people behave. that said, generalising about a group of people is never cool, and rape cases can only be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. it is tricky and complicated and dangerous. which is why it makes sense to look at context. > to say that women and men are equal is simply incorrect. now let us just look at this bit. feminists believe that 'men and women should be equal'. my pse teacher in school used to say 'men and women are different but equal' and i think this illustrated my point pretty well. men and women are fundamentally not the same, but we should have equal rights and be seen as having equal worth in society. men and women are not the same, but they are equal.",cuexczo,686.8327454155548,0,1440502595,100,14,38611,0,77.00385057471264,290.0,397.0,21.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.23809523809523808,0.047619047619047616,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.047619047619047616,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.10511904761904763,0.22413793103448276,0.0,0,0.0,298,36.02,84.30,24.08,20.67,14.19,10.40,90.27,56.38,12.42,6.04,1.34,0.67,3.02,0.00,1.01,6.38,3.69,13.09,13.76,5.70,8.39,2.01,21.48,8.39,5.70,1.68,1.34,5.03,5.03,2.35,2.68,0.00,2.01,0.00,14.09,0.00,0.67,3.02,2.01,15.10,3.69,2.35,2.01,1.34,2.01,4.36,4.70,2.35,1.34,0.34,1.68,0.00,0.00,1.34,0.00,3.02,2.01,0.00,0.34,0.00,0.67,3.69,14.77,0.67,9.40,0.67,6.38,2.35,1.34,0.34,0.00,0.34,0.00,0.00,0.67,0.00,0.00,0.34,0.34,0.00,14.43,7.05,4.36,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.67,0.00,2.01,0.00,0.34

t3_3c17uc,"the start screen, whether you like it or not is really up to personal preference (though most people do not seem to like it, i could see why someone would). personally i think it just gets in the way, because i am way more of a power user and i would rather just paste in commands to a terminal than go through a confusing gui. so i think that's the most divisive thing-- people who like it do not *love* it, but people who hate it really, really hate it. the fact that you can't disable it makes it worse (though i have not seen the classic shell you mention, so i can't evaluate how good that is). to me the biggest problem with windows 8 and the main reason i do not use it is the ram usage. from what i have read, the start menu is always kept open because they want it to be easy for you to switch between the traditional desktop screen and the tablet like screen. yet that destroys ram. i had windows 7 and 8 on the same computer, and windows 8 used maybe 50% or so more ram (this was a few years ago, so i unfortunately do not have the exact numbers anymore). i do not play any games so i have no reason to have a powerful computer, so to me ram is really important. for people who are using a computer for gaming, a lot of them do not like the control microsoft has over windows 8 (the reason gabe newell wants to switch gaming to linux) and a lot of them think windows 8 just runs games slower (i wouldn't really know, though from what i have seen, it is about on par with windows 7). so, for the average user, windows 8 is just a confusing mess. sure, some people will prefer it, just because of differences in preference, but most people, for ram and design purposes, would rather use windows 7, mac, or linux",csrd5oq,282.9665153748664,0,1435961413,24,8,1330,0,63.855521064301584,328.0,437.0,11.0,3,0.0,0.0,0.45454545454545453,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09090909090909091,0.0,0.0,0.5454545454545454,0.08309523809523808,0.19817073170731708,0.0,0,0.0,336,35.78,19.41,37.24,25.77,28.00,14.88,88.10,57.14,14.88,7.14,5.06,0.00,1.19,0.00,0.89,7.74,7.44,10.42,9.23,8.04,8.04,3.27,17.26,4.76,3.87,2.38,2.98,3.27,5.65,2.68,2.68,0.60,0.89,0.00,6.55,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,22.02,3.57,4.46,3.87,4.46,1.19,8.04,1.79,1.79,0.00,0.00,0.30,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,5.36,1.19,0.60,2.68,0.60,0.60,2.08,13.99,0.60,6.25,0.89,3.27,2.38,1.49,1.49,2.38,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,15.48,3.27,6.55,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.60,0.00,1.19,2.98,0.89

t3_333cqy,"> creationism and certain views that contradict plausible science that has been proven again and again. a lot of christians and religious people over all do agree that evolution exists. one of the best parts of religion is that it should not be taken literally, and should be interpreted by the person. there are some people who take that the world was created in seven days and believe it. there are others who read that and think that the seven days is actually hundreds of millions of years. it all comes down to interpretation. > the fact that there is such a harsh distinction between the two possible afterlives: endless punishment or endless paradise, and the fact that someone evil like ted bundy, ""confessed"" and apologized for his sins before execution, would be sent to heaven and a virtuous, amazing human being like bill gates would be sent to hell because he is an atheist. i'm guessing if you were to adopt a religion it would be christianity, because in other religions, this really is not a thing. in mormonism, there is not a hell. there are only circles of heaven. in judaism, there is not much emphasis on the after life at all. i do not know too much about christianity, so i hope this will suffice. >anti-gay, anti-contraception and other repressive movements in the name of religion. the anti-gay, anti-contraception, and the like movements just a vocal minority. if you were to ask an average christian or what have you, they would most likely be in favor of gay marriage, contraception, and other such things. > the fact that there are so many religions, and within those, many different denominations and inconsistencies. how can one possible say their belief is the absolute truth, held above the others? the same could be said about political view. you have a political view that you believe to be the best, above all of the others. there may be many others, but yours makes the most sense to you. the same applies to religion. > various miracles and stories (like noah's ark) in the bible are hard to believe. if you believe that there may be a god, who's to say that he could not intervene and make miracles such as noah's arc a reality. fun fact; one of moses most remarkable tasks, crossing the red sea, was actually possible. i remember watching this documentary of how a lot of what moses did was surprisingly possible, and i distinctly remember that the way he could have ""parted"" the red sea was by simply learning the tide of the red sea, and crossing at the lowest tide possible. just a fun little tidbit on how something that seems impossible could actually be true.",cqh6bst,899.671337547707,0,1429420198,51,17,3253,0,62.69004048582998,456.0,681.0,26.0,0,0.07692307692307693,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.7692307692307693,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9615384615384616,0.08514285714285715,0.23684210526315788,0.0,0,0.0,460,53.91,52.61,9.87,58.68,17.69,19.78,90.00,57.17,12.61,4.13,1.09,0.00,1.74,0.87,0.43,8.48,8.70,11.30,11.74,6.52,6.96,1.30,17.61,6.74,3.70,1.74,1.74,3.70,5.65,3.70,1.96,0.22,0.87,0.22,7.39,0.22,0.00,0.00,0.87,19.78,3.48,1.74,3.26,5.22,3.26,5.65,3.04,1.52,0.87,0.43,0.87,0.00,0.22,0.65,0.00,3.48,0.22,0.65,2.61,0.87,0.00,3.48,10.43,0.87,7.17,1.09,4.57,1.52,1.30,0.43,0.22,0.22,5.00,0.22,0.65,0.43,0.00,0.22,0.00,0.00,15.87,5.43,5.65,0.22,0.22,0.22,0.00,0.87,0.87,0.87,0.43,1.09

t3_2xmiyf,"i think there is a lot of flaws with his arguments. * firstly if it was only pharmaceutical companies doing it for profit, you wouldn't see countries with socialised medical care using the same vaccines. * secondly, he is grossly misrepresenting how easy it is for any kind of drug for human consumption to come to market. multiple trials, millions of dollars in research, reviews, limited availability before being fully available. * thirdly all this is doing is trying to entrench doubt much like creationists and climate change deniers do. using personal opinion and feelings to create uncertainty in how much actual scientific data supports the overwhelming positives in vaccines compared to the minor risks. this might not be a problem if it was not for a herd immunity. not only are the people dramatically increasing preventable risks to themselves, but to people who simply can't get vaccinated because of allergy's, weakened immune systems or are just too young. * lastly. the mountains of research to back up the validity of vaccines. the only research paper i am aware of that was able to produce a link, was done by andrew wakefield. no one has ever been able to repeat his trials using his methodology. and if you watch this video it shows that he knowingly tampered with his results to show what he wanted, while having a financial conflict of interest.

t3_3e5wnt,"while there are certainly some issues with the euro, it is not all doom and gloom. there are great costs to doing business across currencies. not only does one need to pay to exchange them into a local currency, but one must hedge against a great deal of risk from adjustments between the currencies. the uncertainty of currency fluctuations reduces trade and investment. the problems inside the euro largely come from long-term trade deficits, particularly between germany and peripheral european states in violation of euro rules and against the complaints of internal and external partners, including the united states. there has been a flow of money into germany and not nearly enough money flowing back out to achieve a balance and this has gone on since the euro's inception. without a mechanism to redistribute funds back out, it certainly is an unsustainable arrangement and will lead to dissolution. however, this need not be the case. if european states were to agree to play by the rules they made for themselves and take steps to end these chronic trade imbalances, there would be a monetary transfer to counteract the imbalances. this would allow for easier trade within the euro zone as well as fiscal stability for member states. the question is what ""should"" happen, and that depends very much on how idealistic we want to be and what those ideals are. ""should"" germany and to a lesser degree france and several of the smaller states be pushed into direct monetary transfers to the economically disadvantaged states in their union? i think there is a reasonable argument that they should and that they would be best off in the long-run for it. however, if one feels that this policy would alienate these populations leading to unsustainable instability, then there is also a good argument on the other side. in the end, it really depends on how much germany is willing to change they way they do business and play fair in order to preserve the euro. my feeling is that most germans identify more closely in their hearts as germans than as europeans, but if pressed with a difficult situation, it is difficult to predict what they will do. i hope that they would seek to strengthen their ties with their neighbors, but fear that they would instead withdraw. if they did embrace europe, then these economic imbalances can certainly be lessened such that the costs of being in the euro are outweighed by the benefits. this is not a problem of economics, it is a problem of politics and social identity.",ctbv25s,203.67952216768128,0,1437551407,17,5,6330,0,49.88115667074666,430.0,681.0,19.0,0,0.21052631578947367,0.0,0.3684210526315789,0.6842105263157895,0.0,0.05263157894736842,0.0,0.10526315789473684,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.21052631578947367,0.0,1.631578947368421,0.04654151222778674,0.2744186046511628,0.0,0,0.0,432,75.93,44.48,13.39,38.09,22.74,23.61,86.11,56.94,10.65,4.40,0.69,0.23,0.00,0.00,3.47,6.25,8.10,16.20,9.95,4.86,8.10,1.39,13.66,3.94,2.31,1.16,0.69,1.62,7.87,4.17,3.47,0.69,0.69,0.46,5.56,0.00,0.46,0.00,0.00,15.28,1.39,2.55,5.32,2.78,1.39,5.09,0.93,0.23,0.00,0.69,0.46,0.23,0.23,0.00,0.00,7.87,1.39,1.39,2.78,1.85,1.85,1.39,9.03,1.39,12.50,2.78,7.64,2.31,4.40,0.46,0.23,6.25,0.23,0.00,0.46,0.00,0.00,0.23,0.23,0.00,9.72,4.17,3.70,0.00,0.00,0.23,0.00,0.46,0.93,0.23,0.00,0.00

t3_37zdvz,"the policy consideration of torts and criminal law are difference. theories of justice really are not applicable to torts because the policy goal is to make a person ""whole"" through monetary compensation and, possibly, injunctions. it is a private action between two or more similarly situated parties - ""similarly situated"" in that the law presumes private actors are more or less equal, in contrast to criminal law and its protections against presumptively greater state power, and the more extreme consequences that can follow from prosecution (jail or possibly death.) using torts as a substitute for justice may lack prudence or wisdom precisely because it lacks those protections. similarly, it begs the question as to whether private actors are, realistically, similarly situated; we all know some people have more money, time and resources to devote to litigation. that said, it is unfair to take those theories of justice and apply them to a context for which they were never intended and then decry the proposal as wrong or inappropriate. edit: moreover, depending on how we define ""libertarian"" (libertarian party? minarchist?) we might not be talking about state monopolized courts. there are definitely libertarian political philosophies out there that opt for privatized court systems, thus it might not ultimately be government action. it is hard to say without a defined platform, even if we assume the best characterization on your part with respect to whether most libertarians prefer restitution over other policies. edit 2: also, my familiarity with libertarians is that issues are commonly looked through a contractual lens rather than tortious conduct. again, this may lack wisdom but i am not sure it is the best or most accurate characterization of issues raised by libertarians. everything is seemingly transactional, where the wrong behavior is viewed as a breach rather than negligent or intentionally harmful. people are allowed to breach contracts and rather than being viewed as punishable or worthy of compensation, you have to pay damages (calculated through various formulas, not the holistic view of how much having sex with your partner might have been worth -- a real tort action.) there is such a thing as efficient breach and it is far less condemnable.",crr4191,386.59306618443475,0,1433106359,54,6,-18530,0,36.76287136426595,361.0,628.0,16.0,72,0.5,0.0625,0.625,0.4375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3125,0.0625,0.0625,0.0,2.0625,0.059283182704235333,0.31301939058171746,0.0,0,0.0,362,62.55,42.33,12.47,76.76,22.62,29.28,85.08,49.72,8.84,3.04,0.55,1.10,0.83,0.00,0.55,5.80,5.25,13.26,9.12,5.52,9.12,1.93,13.26,9.67,7.46,1.66,0.55,4.14,6.63,4.70,1.93,0.00,0.28,0.00,6.35,0.00,0.28,0.00,0.00,20.44,3.04,3.31,2.21,6.91,2.21,7.73,1.38,0.55,0.55,0.28,0.28,0.00,0.00,0.28,0.00,11.33,1.93,1.10,6.35,1.10,2.21,1.66,9.39,1.66,4.97,1.38,2.49,1.10,3.59,1.10,0.00,1.93,0.00,0.28,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,14.09,3.87,4.70,0.55,0.28,0.55,0.00,0.83,1.66,0.00,1.66,0.00

t3_31kfkt,"there are a few things that you should keep in mind before you make your decision: 1) you are 22 years old. since you have been suffering for many years i think you have probably read up about the facts of your disease. statistically, you are at a *dangerous* age when it comes to suicide. most young people who think about (or attempt) suicide at your age grow out of it as they mature. your case is certainly severe --multiple visits to hospitals, many therapists, etc-- but if you take your own life now then you forego any chance of getting better. when coupled with the fact that you are not really getting ""better"" by committing suicide, it is probably a good idea to wait it out and let your brain get older before you make the decision. the decision itself is still your own, but thinking of the consequences before you make your decision is always better, is not it? 2) speaking of consequences, here is something that you should think of too. you feel that you need to stay alive so that other people do not get hurt. like it or not, that is how it is. to be really consistent, you have to weigh your pain against the pain that losing you would cause your family, friends, acquaintances, and on and on. then realize that their pain, though it will lose its edge, will remain with them for their whole life. you will not be there so it will not affect you, but the pain will stay with them for as long as they live. this is a consequentialist's argument. does removing the pain that you are experiencing outweigh the pain that will arise from your absence? again, the choice is your own, but i am trying to add considerations for you so that you might hopefully change your view about the ""right"" you have. 3) one more thing, you spoke of the freedom to choose. well, that's a weak argument. no, every choice is not available to every person. the choices available are the ones you consider, the ones that you can see or are made available to you. when you were choosing which college to go to, did you consider going to peru and majoring in agricultural studies? i doubt it. what i am trying to say is that in your current (and recent) state of mind, there are options that you cannot see. it could be that you will make your way out of your present condition and look back and realize that this choice you are talking about is like that of an animal in a zoo. you can't see beyond the cage. yet. finally, though you didn't ask for my advice, i hope you stick around. give yourself time. use *whatever* resources are available to you, be shameless in asking for help so that you can help others when you have the opportunity. good luck.",cq2q8ub,733.1698470420763,0,1428304549,145,32,499,0,76.45246319018406,489.0,658.0,30.0,114,0.1,0.0,0.2,0.26666666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.03333333333333333,0.06666666666666667,0.03333333333333333,0.7333333333333333,0.08620689655172414,0.2085889570552147,0.0,0,0.0,493,22.59,96.89,45.26,12.37,16.43,13.39,92.90,62.47,22.11,13.39,1.22,0.00,10.95,0.00,1.22,8.72,4.87,13.18,11.56,6.90,6.29,2.23,21.50,3.85,3.04,1.83,1.01,2.23,5.88,2.43,3.45,0.41,0.41,0.81,16.23,0.20,0.41,0.00,0.00,17.24,4.06,2.84,1.62,3.65,1.42,5.07,3.65,1.01,0.61,1.62,3.45,0.20,2.84,0.00,0.20,6.29,0.81,1.62,1.42,2.64,1.42,1.22,16.23,2.64,11.56,1.83,4.46,5.88,1.01,0.20,0.20,0.00,0.00,0.81,0.20,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.20,0.00,16.23,5.48,5.27,0.20,0.00,0.61,0.00,0.81,0.81,0.81,1.42,0.81

t3_3bnan1,"there are a few things about poverty you are not likely to realize coming from a wealthy background. * social capital the lack of social capital poor people have is a huge barrier. people help out their friends and relatives all the time. sometimes it is small stuff like a ride to work when your car breaks down. sometimes it is big stuff like finding a job. or a loan of a nice suit to go to an interview. or the name of a good accountant for some tax issue. simply by virtue of running in wealthy circles, you likely have a deep network of people with the resources to help you out of a lot of jams. if your car didn't start this morning, and you had to be somewhere reallly important this afternoon (say a court hearing you absolutely must be there for), how many different ways could you solve that problem? you could pay for a taxi. you could get a rental car. you probably have a bunch of friends and family with cars. etc. and this is for a minor issue. if everyone around you is poor, problems like this can compound. maybe you can what to you was a minor hassle can end up being a catastrophe. * stress when you have savings and social support, you have a lot less to stress about, financially. for instance, i recently switched car insurance to save $20 a month. during the switch, state farm accidentally dinged my account for $115. since i have a substantial amount of savings, this was no big deal. i called them, fixed the issue, and they are mailing me a check. but if i needed that $115 to pay for rent or gas or something, it would be a huge deal. when your account is near zero, you need to watch it like a hawk. having to be hyper vigilant like that drains your mental energy needed for developing plans and taking risks. plus you just can't take risks when your survival depends on them paying off. calling in sick for an interview for a new job is not something that's easy to do when you really depend on each day's pay. * desperation in many cases, being broke makes you desperate, and that leads to decisions that seem stupid in hindsight. when you do not have a way to put gas in the car or get your kid a winter coat, you might end up getting into debt, which then compounds on itself. when you shop for a car for instance, you often have the luxury of taking your time to shop around, play dealers off each other, look for good financing terms, or go pay cash for something on craigslist. if you only have a thousand bucks to put down and bad credit, you are likely going to take any deal you can get, because you need a car asap to get to work. so you end up shopping at a scummy buy here pay here dealership which charges $3000 above blue book for the car and 10% interest because it is the only place that will give you anything.",csnqn07,557.2433995902264,0,1435688866,47,18,3932,0,75.97129588431592,522.0,702.0,31.0,141,0.0,0.0,0.03225806451612903,0.25806451612903225,0.0,0.0,0.03225806451612903,0.06451612903225806,0.0,0.06451612903225806,0.0,0.0,0.03225806451612903,0.0,0.4838709677419354,0.027163775766716945,0.25862068965517243,0.0,0,0.0,527,72.01,89.46,26.70,25.77,17.00,14.42,89.94,56.17,14.42,8.54,1.14,0.00,6.64,0.00,0.76,5.69,7.97,15.56,8.73,5.12,6.45,1.14,14.99,3.61,1.33,2.09,1.33,2.47,5.69,2.85,2.85,1.14,0.19,0.19,11.76,0.38,0.38,0.00,0.00,12.33,0.95,1.71,3.23,5.69,0.76,3.61,0.95,0.57,0.38,0.00,0.19,0.00,0.19,0.00,0.00,11.01,1.71,1.14,4.93,2.28,1.52,1.52,11.39,1.14,14.80,3.23,6.26,5.31,3.80,1.33,0.57,5.88,0.00,0.00,0.38,0.00,0.19,0.19,0.00,0.00,12.90,5.69,4.36,0.00,0.00,0.19,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.76,0.38,1.52

t3_346hwk,"ok, lets throw out everything that we are assuming about her/her son before and after the video. we see a child in a dangerous situation and a parent who cares enough to go down there and save him. this single action, a parent making the effort to prevent further harm to their child through discipline, *is* an example of good parenting. everything else you are assuming, just like others are assuming in the positive. the kids of good parents can still be caught up in things that they never normally would and neither you, or anyone else, is in any position to make a judgement as to whether or not that is the case here. if you want to make this discussion about her hitting the kid, the easiest response to that would be: it's clearly a highly intense situation which required *immediate* action from both the mother and her child. i claim that both parties were not in any position to sit down and have a ""frank discussion"" about why the actions of the teenager were inappropriate, and as such, using rapid physical correction is an appropriate response. this response is compounded by the fact that the teenager seems to be at least of a size where he would be able to resist the mother if she were to simply try to use physical restraint in order to remove him from the rioting. you have no idea whether or not she physically disciplined the teen after he was removed from the immediate danger and it is wrong of you to assume that she did and use it as an argument against her. all of this hinges on what the facts are: this woman put herself in danger to stop her child from making a bad decision that could have hurt him or had a profound impact on the rest of his life. that alone, is the action of a good parent. anything else is you projecting and assuming, which is not appropriate.",cqrsts3,429.42129892573223,0,1430254257,114,0,-19229,0,58.247128378378406,333.0,474.0,12.0,10,0.08333333333333333,0.0,0.08333333333333333,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.08333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.08333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.6666666666666667,0.07393162393162393,0.2072072072072072,0.0,0,0.0,334,72.15,85.95,9.62,25.77,27.83,17.66,93.41,61.98,16.47,8.38,0.30,0.90,1.80,4.79,0.60,8.08,9.88,16.17,9.58,3.89,6.29,2.10,14.97,5.99,3.29,2.40,0.30,2.10,5.39,2.69,2.69,0.00,0.30,0.60,15.87,2.40,0.00,3.89,2.10,17.07,2.40,3.29,2.40,5.09,2.69,5.39,0.90,0.60,0.00,0.30,1.20,0.00,1.20,0.00,0.00,11.08,2.69,0.90,4.19,1.20,2.10,2.10,10.78,0.00,12.28,3.29,6.29,2.40,0.60,0.60,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.30,0.00,0.00,0.30,0.00,0.00,9.88,3.59,3.29,0.60,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.60,0.30,0.00,1.50

t3_3cntuq,"the ""argument from human nature"" gets brought up a lot but is surprisingly easy to refute. from all the socialist books i have read, (and i do not know if you have read any), it is never required theoretically that people should become perfect. instead, socialism as a theory is conceptualised as one which will more perfectly fit human nature as it is. firstly, what is human nature? the first thing we can say about it is that it is very varied. it is just whatever humans do. but humans do a lot of things. the central mistake that proponents of the argument from human nature make is a kind of ""begging the question"". they assume that human behaviour in a capitalist system must be the paradigm of human behaviour per se. i think this is demonstrably false, as a moment's reflection will show. for the vast majority of time that humans have existed, they were hunter-gatherers, living in fairly small communities or tribes and practising some form or other of primitive communism, ie, sharing the spoils of the hunt. social structures were also more or less egalitarian, necessarily, because of required co-operation in the hunt. if mankind has a species character, it will be informed by being a hunter-gatherer, living in a social group. other social forms, cities, states, capitalism, consumerism, and so on, are much later, much more recent developments. so what we can take from this about human nature? 1. humans are a social species, they can collaborate and join their labour together for the common good. 2, humans are creative, and find meaning and dignity in creativity. and you can also, more tentatively, add: 3. humans are at their best when free to contract the kinds of social relationships and pursue the creative activities they want. well this exactly accords with the species character of man described by marx and, before him, by the philosophers of the enlightenment. man is given naturally to free, cooperative, creative labour. now comes the industrial revolution. the industrial revolution transformed the farm worker into a factory worker, a proletariat. labour became *necessarily* collaborative again. socialism is nothing more, at a basic level, than a theoretical response to these facts about human nature and human creativity, and the facts of limited global resources and labour. if you want to, you can look at it merely as a rational, efficient use of resources and labour, getting rid of unproductive classes, middlemen, profiteers, production of useless commodities, and so on. so to sum up, your ""argument from human nature"" is, as usual when this argument is brought up, based on the usual question-begging and is, i am sorry to say, based on something of a strawman socialism. i recommend that you read up on the topic and you will see that no serious socialist writer demands or expects perfectibility. your other objection, that socialism, in order to function properly, would require a world-wide system, is more serious and has more force to it. but that was only ever a long-term goal and it does not follow that we can't try to achieve change in our day-to-day lives, and in our own local polities. after all, world-wide changes have been affected before and they will be again. i would also briefly say that very few people advocate a soviet-style system these days. no-one is anxious to recreate the days of stalin and gulags and show trials. but once you grasp that that was a deviation from the course of socialism proper, (and was recognised as such at the time by perceptive critics), the goals of socialism in the present day become all the more clear.",csxd1md,526.0062941508243,0,1436451783,55,17,10792,0,52.84115789473685,608.0,980.0,35.0,2,0.14285714285714285,0.0,0.14285714285714285,0.11428571428571428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02857142857142857,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02857142857142857,0.08571428571428572,0.5428571428571428,0.06032913165266107,0.26480263157894735,0.0,0,0.0,621,71.47,77.54,24.75,46.54,17.74,21.42,86.15,50.89,10.63,4.51,0.97,0.81,1.45,0.16,1.13,6.12,7.89,12.88,9.34,4.03,8.21,1.13,14.49,7.25,3.70,0.97,1.29,3.54,4.35,2.74,1.61,0.16,0.64,0.32,10.63,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.48,14.01,2.74,2.74,1.77,3.54,2.42,3.22,1.61,0.81,0.48,0.16,0.64,0.00,0.64,0.00,0.00,9.82,3.70,2.74,2.58,1.93,0.32,1.93,10.63,0.97,11.92,1.45,5.80,4.51,5.31,0.16,0.00,0.97,0.00,0.00,0.16,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.16,0.00,18.36,5.31,8.53,0.16,0.00,0.32,0.00,1.77,0.97,0.32,0.64,0.32

t3_32xbei,"while racial experiences of asian-americans today do not necessarily match up with the racial experiences of black americans or lgbtq people, etc, it does not necessarily mean that they do not experience issues due to their racial or ethnic identity. this is usually called a ""model minority"" status (compare to perceptions of jewish people in america). one issue is that while asian-americans are from a very diverse array of cultures, they are often lumped into one ""pan-asian"" identity, where the vast cultural differences are ignored. while achievement and high status are not necessarily negative perceptions, being a model minority is still a stereotype that can negatively affect asian-americans. asian-american demographics could be bi-modal, in that they are disproportionately represented on both the high-status achievement and low-status failure. in addition, these demographic differences could be further broken down into specific ethnic groups. because asian-americans are perceived to have ""made it,"" they might be less likely to report and receive help for real issues. and, despite their perceived success, asian-americans have very poor media representation. fresh off the boat is the first show about an asian family in about 20 years. while you can remind people of their privilege due to socioeconomic status, i do not think asian-americans enjoy a sense of privilege in the same vein that white people do. the advantage is not as structurally entrenched and historically consistent.

t3_338jvv,"your opinions seems to be influenced by the fact that you are indifferent to anything beyond your life, which is perfectly rational. however, i think there is a difference between this indifference and a lack of preference for human continuation. i would say that i care about the future beyond my life, but that i would care less if i didn't have children or any vested interest in the future, solely because i care for people i know and presumably for my future children. i think that these are important factors into the valuation of the future, so i propose the following three scenarios to challenge your opinion: * **you vs. them:** suppose a scenario arises in which either you can die with 100% certainty for the survival of the group, or you all die, and only you can make the decision. do you decide to take everyone down with you, or die for the preservation of their lives (also with 100% certainty from that event)? if you sacrifice yourself, then what preferences do you have for their well being that you do not share with the rest of humanity? if you take everyone down with you, then your decision is not inconsistent with your views of humanity, but then, you are likely to be regarded as being selfish or unethical for this decision. would your code of ethics as you apply it in the apocalypse be the same as you would apply them here? * **you have a child:** either by accident or purposefully, you end up creating a child. do you feel any responsibility for that child? if you do, do you not think that there is some vested interest in safeguarding that child's life beyond your own? if you do not feel any responsibility, do you think it is ethical for you to externalize that responsibility to someone else? * **there is some chance of continuation:** suppose that through your travels you hear of a possible revival of society somewhere that seems to be getting off to a good start. how do you form your opinion on the restarting of society? are you a pessimist, in that society existed before and wrought the apocalypse, or are you an optimist, in that you believe that people learn from their mistakes, especially catastrophic mistakes such as that which brought about the apocalypse? in the end, it comes down to your preferences over your life versus events beyond your life, which boils down to who you know during the apocalypse, and how you form your ethical opinions about the world. i think that ethics change though, and they may change in these scenarios.",cqixu9t,124.64077210030644,0,1429569321,61,12,24991,0,55.4298173515982,438.0,656.0,18.0,4,0.05555555555555555,0.0,0.16666666666666666,0.6666666666666666,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.0,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16666666666666666,0.0,1.2222222222222223,0.09940925087983912,0.182648401826484,0.0,0,0.0,440,48.83,95.35,40.42,68.66,25.88,19.77,89.09,62.95,22.05,14.09,2.73,0.00,10.00,0.00,1.36,7.73,6.36,16.82,8.41,5.00,7.50,1.14,16.14,2.27,2.27,1.82,0.68,2.27,4.09,3.18,0.91,0.00,0.00,0.23,16.36,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,19.77,5.00,2.27,3.41,6.59,1.82,5.68,1.14,0.23,0.45,0.45,1.59,0.00,1.36,0.00,0.00,6.14,0.45,1.14,3.18,1.14,0.45,0.45,14.09,1.82,9.55,1.36,5.23,2.95,1.14,0.23,0.00,0.00,0.23,0.68,0.23,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.23,0.00,15.00,2.27,5.23,0.91,0.00,1.82,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.45,0.45,3.86

t3_3injsb,">the need for moral guidance in life - to need guidance from religion to know the difference between right and wrong is also a sign of weakness in that it shows a lack of judgement and wisdom for one to decide for themselves what is right or wrong. furthermore, the need of a consequence by eternal damnation as persuasion not to do ""bad things"", and the need of an incentive by eternal salvation to do good. is a sign of weakness in that it shows that human-nature is bad, or barbaric in a sense. i view the endless evolution of religious perspectives over the course of human existence to to be something of an ongoing debate about morality. certainly some people get stuck in religious dogma, but rather i think that our evolving sense of morality is the driving force behind new religions, new sects, new interpretations, etc. we have always been constantly thinking and arguing about what is right and what is wrong. the variety of religious teachings reflect this debate, rather then the other way around. >the need for an afterlife in most religions satisfies our general fears of death, and the impermanence and futility of our lives. the theory is not backed by much scientific evidence as far as i know, so the reason to believe in an afterlife is not that it makes more sense but that it makes life easier. a fear of death and impermanence so strong that one must believe in something that i would categorize as fairytale. this is what i would call a weakness. your entire argument hinges on the idea that no afterlife can possibly exist, because it has not been rigorously proven to exist by science, and so having the idea that it exists is weak. by that token it was once weak to believe that humans might be able to fly, and it was weak to think that the earth revolved around the sun. by that view it is currently weak to believe that there might be life elsewhere in the universe, because it has not been proven to be true yet. there might actually be an afterlife. there might not be. as of now, there really is not any way to know, because we have not invented a way of observing that yet. but to say that it is weak to have an idea that there might be means that you must hold the view that one should not hold any concept or idea until perfect knowledge is attainable, a mentality that i myself rather find to be weak.",cui4ily,701.4843358662941,0,1440726504,50,14,9103,0,60.047862206754345,431.0,624.0,18.0,0,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.4444444444444444,0.6111111111111112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05555555555555555,0.0,1.2222222222222223,NaN,0.2111368909512761,0.0,0,0.0,432,65.17,37.29,45.81,7.22,24.00,18.29,92.82,58.56,13.19,3.47,1.62,1.16,0.46,0.00,0.23,9.72,7.87,15.51,10.88,5.09,6.94,2.31,16.90,6.71,2.31,0.93,0.93,1.85,5.79,2.08,3.70,0.46,0.69,0.00,4.40,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,20.37,6.94,1.85,3.24,3.70,2.08,5.09,2.08,1.16,0.23,0.00,2.31,0.00,2.31,0.00,0.00,7.64,1.16,0.69,3.47,0.69,1.62,1.62,13.19,1.62,9.95,0.69,5.79,3.47,0.93,0.00,0.00,0.00,3.47,0.46,0.23,0.23,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,9.49,4.17,3.94,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.46,0.46,0.00,0.00,0.46

t3_31iyzr,"you make a lot of good points, but i am not at all convinced by this: > the swedish society seems ""calmer"" that what i believe happens in the us. there are of course cases of racism and public disobedience, but not to the extend of fergusson or some other similar events. according to a quick google search: the population of the us is 318.9 million. the population of sweden is 9.593 million. doing the math: the us has over 33 times more people than sweden. even if the two places were identical in all other respects, you can expect 33 times more of *everything,* including the really bad stuff. and the news prioritizes the really bad stuff. the us is also really, really big. again, going from lazy google searches: sweden is some 173,000 square miles, or about 450,000 square kilometers. the us is some 3.8 *million* square miles, or 9.8 *million* square kilometers. it is also mostly empty -- our population is massively concentrated on the coasts. if you are in it, the obvious likely place you would end up is silicon valley, which is about a two *thousand* mile drive from ferguson. that's a longer drive than it is from stockholm (sweden) to madrid (spain). you are considerably closer to kiev (ukrane), which literally *is* a war zone. whether you actually want to be in the bay area is another question, but that's not the point. you can live in new york city, which, to be fair, is only some 968 miles from ferguson. point is, the us is big, and if you really have companies begging you to come here, you can probably afford to pick a part of it that's not at all like ferguson. a quick run-down of your other points: > salaries seem much better in the us (both on paper and assuming that taxation is higher in sweden). however, some huge differences seem to exist between different areas in the us... yep, largely because cost of living can be vastly different. i mentioned the bay area -- look at the rent here, and compare it to the rent in, say, iowa or texas. > sweden has a state supported health system, which means that worst case scenario i will pay in a year approx $120 for doctor visits (medication not included). even operations and ""longer"" treatment is covered by this amount. this is definitely not the picture i have from the us, where a sickness can destroy you financially. this is why, in the us, people generally have health insurance. if you took a reasonably well-paid it job, you could expect your employer to *also* pay for your health insurance, and probably that of your immediate family. this is a profoundly *weird* system, but it means that if you are well-paid, it is probably not worse for you here than it is in a country with socialized medicine. of course, it is *much* worse if you are poor. > vacation days seem also to be quite different. in sweden the norm seems to be 25-30 vacation days per year, while in the us is 15-21 (?). plus, vacation and sick days are totally different pools. when you get sick you are not paid for the first day, but you receive full pay up to day 14 of sickness. not sure how this works in the us. it varies *massively* from company to company. if you ever decide to come here, you need to research this thoroughly. some companies give almost no time off, netflix gives as much as you want. most are somewhere in between. that said, here, two weeks is about the norm. more than that is considered generous. this is one thing that makes me envious of europe in general.",cq2ggm1,1813.7069286283663,0,1428284287,146,24,7539,0,70.19807832422589,610.0,886.0,45.0,7,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.13333333333333333,0.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022222222222222223,0.022222222222222223,0.0,0.022222222222222223,0.022222222222222223,0.022222222222222223,0.0,0.5555555555555556,0.043037518037518034,0.23278688524590163,0.0,0,0.0,630,60.36,70.54,54.94,16.66,15.75,15.71,87.46,55.40,14.13,7.14,0.95,2.06,4.13,0.00,0.00,6.83,7.14,13.49,9.37,6.51,5.87,1.59,14.29,6.83,4.44,1.59,4.29,3.33,3.81,1.59,2.22,0.00,0.48,0.16,8.89,0.16,0.00,0.00,0.00,15.87,2.38,1.11,2.22,5.71,1.43,7.14,1.59,1.27,0.32,0.00,2.06,0.00,2.06,0.00,0.00,6.83,2.22,0.79,2.38,0.79,0.79,1.27,13.17,0.63,13.49,1.27,8.89,3.49,3.17,0.95,0.48,2.54,0.00,0.16,0.48,0.00,0.16,0.16,0.32,0.00,22.22,6.67,6.51,0.79,0.00,0.16,0.00,1.43,0.63,0.48,1.90,3.65
t3_3jn9lh,"i would argue that safety does not always have to be some value that trumps everything else. i grew up racing motocross.

[both in industry and research.](if you boycott taxes because they subsidize animal cruelty and death but do not care that they subsidize human death and suffering, that would be inconsistent and awful. but you do care -- you just do not want to break the law for it. which is reasonable, not paying taxes has huge consequences for you, would also defund your share of welfare, roads and things you probably feel you should pay your part of --- and is a horribly ineffective means to stop the cruelty metted out by the government. > the clothes i wear were made in a sweatshop, the fruits and vegetables i eat were picked by illegal immigrants, my phone and computer contain metals that people died to secure doing one thing wrong is absolutely never a justification for doing other things wrong. also, you could work on making some of these things better. however human issues are never as simple except in the extreme cases. is it better than undocumented immigrants do not have jobs or that they have shitty, exploitive jobs. neither is ok! we need to support immigrant rights! it is harder to know how to put that in practice in the super market, but that's not a reason to give up on being a moral person when you do know what to do. we just need to be vocal about human suffering and support groups addressing those issues as well. > when i do cook (i mostly make soups or chilis, with rice), it takes a lot of time, and it does not taste all that great. make bigger batches. if you eat a lot and do not have time, cook big batches in the beginning of the week. do you not like soups and chilis or is the issue that you are not mimicking chilis you do like well? in the latter case, i think some better recipes could help. /r/veganrecipes are good places for recipes :-). knowing a little more about your budget, your preferences and your goals (and what is available where you live!), /r/vegan is a great source of support and people there will often help you plan out something you actually want to eat. > i do strength training, but i have trouble getting the amount of protein that fitness forums recommend. no, problem - have you heard of [patrik baboumian?](you might be more at ease if you take your advice from vegan fitness forums: * /r/veganfitness * * * * > when my friends invite me out to eat, i often can't eat anything. i am not a very social person, although i would like to be, and this has not helped. :-(. usually calling the restaurant in advance can allow you to figure out some option, even if it is a little shitty. very few restaurants can't finagle anything at all vegan. if your friends are not complete assholes, it should not ruin your friendships that you are just eating the french fries, or the vegetable sandwich with no cheese or mayo or a bowl of rice. (pre-eat though.) or suggests restaraunts which are friendlier! > i am coming to believe that conformity has very real value, even if what we are adhering to was set arbitrarily, because we are social animals and we need to be around others. not when there is injustice. conforming to a culture of violence is wrong. and a culture of not questioning violence - whether it is towards humans (war crimes, abuse of undocumented people, other oppressed people) or animals. you are obviously aware of that, so be part of the change and speak out against all the forms of violence and oppression. veganism is a statement that you are against violence towards animals and you are unwilling to be violent even when it is normal, and that should bolster non violence towards humans -- not conflict with it! but what is more is that veganism is another way to make friends. find vegan groups, there might even be vegan weight lifters near you. they do not have to be your whole social life but it can help to talk to others who also see violence towards animals as violence, and who will be excited to share vegan meals. they will offer support and tips and might just help you feel happier when you are with your other friends. being able to talk to people who understand your perspective even once in a while really can make everything better! smile",cpko3op,1343.6943928468247,0,1426826453,92,16,5475,0,67.19745071441491,970.0,1403.0,57.0,1,0.14035087719298245,0.0,0.15789473684210525,0.17543859649122806,0.0,0.0,0.017543859649122806,0.0,0.017543859649122806,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017543859649122806,0.0,0.5263157894736843,0.034724749456892315,0.22474226804123712,0.0,0,0.0,979,32.48,65.87,33.16,25.77,18.47,18.59,89.17,57.30,15.12,8.48,2.25,1.02,4.70,0.00,0.51,6.64,4.29,12.36,11.44,5.31,8.48,3.17,18.59,3.98,2.55,2.15,0.61,3.17,7.15,3.47,3.47,0.10,1.02,0.82,11.75,0.00,0.61,0.00,0.10,18.08,2.76,2.45,2.76,4.49,1.43,7.66,1.63,0.31,0.41,0.72,3.98,0.61,0.61,0.00,2.76,7.35,2.86,1.33,1.84,1.43,0.92,0.82,14.81,1.02,8.48,0.61,5.41,2.25,1.94,0.72,0.10,0.72,0.20,0.51,1.12,0.31,0.31,0.20,0.31,0.00,16.55,4.70,4.29,0.31,0.00,0.20,0.92,1.23,0.00,0.61,1.63,2.66

t3_3ec84d,"shrinking populations are actually really disruptive and dangerous things. there are many reasons for this but it all basically boils down to less economic activity is bad. first lets consider the direct effects. property prices would plunge. if there are 100 houses and 100 families to fill them you need to build a new house to accommodate the 101st family. the material supplies, land value, and profit margin set the cost of that house. the value of the land is based on what the last piece of land in the area sold for. this is a nice stable system and allows every one of the 100 families who already owns a house to have a house worth hundreds of thousands of dollars (as thats what a new house costs). if however you have 99 families and 100 houses that 100th house is worthless. no one wants it, so no one buys it, no one uses it, and more importantly, if that house is worth $0.00 all of the other houses are worth $0.00 as well. we instantly destroyed the entire community's home values. detroit has a shrinking population and you can buy houses there for less than a cheese burger. next the stock market. stock prices are based, to a large degree, on anticipated future growth of the companies. publicly traded companies tend to sell for 12x their annual earnings. privately traded companies tend to sell for 7x their annual earnings. this is because of the difference in growth prospects. with a declining population and thus declining business activity the stock market would take a huge hit wiping out huge amounts of savings (from people who already lost all the equity in their homes). next comes government debts. right now government services in all of the western world are financed by deficit spending. lenders lend money because they feel the country will be able to pay it back eventually. if however the gdp starts to go down investors will not lend and governments will fall into the trap that snared greece. i could go on and on and on. but population decline is really bad news.",ctdikum,174.4180920067156,0,1437673510,68,11,839,0,69.0982560061715,349.0,512.0,26.0,22,0.0,0.038461538461538464,0.15384615384615385,0.23076923076923078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07692307692307693,0.0,0.5,0.1376031746031746,0.30659025787965616,0.0,0,0.0,356,83.22,53.37,23.04,30.52,14.83,18.54,87.36,47.47,8.43,3.09,0.28,0.56,0.84,0.00,1.40,5.34,8.43,12.64,7.02,4.78,6.74,1.12,13.20,4.21,1.97,1.12,3.93,3.37,3.65,1.97,1.69,0.00,0.28,0.56,5.06,1.12,0.00,0.00,0.00,10.39,1.12,2.53,2.53,1.12,1.69,4.21,0.28,0.00,0.00,0.28,0.84,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.56,8.43,1.97,0.84,3.65,1.12,0.84,1.12,10.39,2.25,13.48,1.69,7.58,4.49,5.62,1.12,4.78,9.27,0.00,0.00,0.28,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.28,0.00,10.96,6.74,2.25,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.28,1.12,0.56

t3_3csg70,"punk music originated amongst people lacking traditional music training and the resources to make professional-sounding music. they were often performing for small groups of people in non-traditional venues. that is the same as early hip-hop. punk music can be made by people with limited talent. but a talented (not trained, talented) guitarist, bassist, drummer and screamer can make short, fast songs that make people excited. early punk was only accidentally groundbreaking. just as brooklyn kids didn't have full bands for their parties so they used djs, punks could not play well so they turned up the distortion and did the best they could. but in time, punk evolved. it kept the short, fast and simple style, but there actually are talented singer/songerwriters in punk, as well as great (if not virtuoso) instrumentation. compare the djing of early hip-hop to modern radio hits. it sounds completely different. but that is only because we have listened enough to understand the subtlety. an old fuddy-duddy might say that both aesop rock and mobb deep are both guys talking over drums and pops. would you think it is crazy for me to say that a black flag record sounds very different to me than the misfits. it is loud, sloppy guitars and screamy lyrics, say the fuddy-duddys. true, but i know enough about sloppy guitars and screamy lyrics to know which ones i like and which i don't. i guess the best metaphor is some people say ""if you have seen one football match, you have seen them all."" there are some similarities, for sure. people running around, kicking balls. but the more you get into football, the more you are able to enjoy it. i'd like to give you some homework. listen to ""blitzkrieg bop"" by the ramones. it is like the ""rapper's delight"" of punk. then listen to ""last caress"" by the misfits. the message of the song is that the singer wants to kill a baby, rape a mother, and kill himself. tell me if you think those sound similar.",csyj9wf,322.2906187158911,0,1436538168,51,8,4613,0,71.06821817562968,339.0,491.0,26.0,0,0.07692307692307693,0.0,0.23076923076923078,0.19230769230769232,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07692307692307693,0.07692307692307693,0.07692307692307693,0.0,0.7307692307692306,0.047873015873015866,0.3008849557522124,0.0,0,0.0,346,65.98,68.83,15.97,82.63,13.31,17.05,86.71,47.40,10.98,6.65,2.31,0.29,2.02,0.29,1.73,4.34,6.65,11.27,8.09,4.34,7.80,1.45,16.76,8.38,4.91,0.58,0.29,2.60,7.23,5.20,2.02,0.00,0.87,0.00,11.27,0.58,0.29,0.29,0.58,12.72,1.45,2.02,2.31,2.60,1.16,4.91,8.38,0.87,7.23,0.29,0.87,0.58,0.00,0.29,0.00,4.91,1.73,1.16,1.45,1.45,0.29,3.18,11.27,0.87,8.96,1.73,4.62,3.18,1.16,6.36,0.29,0.00,0.00,0.58,0.58,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.58,0.00,19.36,7.51,5.20,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.73,2.31,1.16,1.16,0.29
t3_32aahp,"at least in most of the us ""rape by deception"" is not a recognized crime. (nor is it in the rest of the world if my quick google search is accurate). so when you say ""guilty of rape by deception"", you are talking about a person being guilty of some vague crime which does not exist yet and is not well defined. i would argure that before you can reasonbly sugest that a person should be jailed for a behavior the exact crime needs to be defined. a few states do make it criminal to obtain consent to sex by pretending to be the husband of the victim (note that these laws are old enough and outdated enough that they apply only to husbands, because at that time laws against rape only applied to female victims - this also tells you these laws are not about emotional distress). california expanded it is law to include boyfriends, but appears to be the only state to have done so, to date, and that's still a very narrow rule. right now, in most places, if a person consents to sex with you believing you are their husband, wife, boyfriend, girlfriend (and they are of a legal age to consent to sex, and they are not so intoxicated to be unable to legally consent), that is not rape. if a trans person obtaining your consent by not revealing their birth gender is analogous to such a situation (as you argue it is), then it seems to follow that in most states it should not be treated as a crime (i'm not convinced that's the right analogy, but that concern can be set aside for the moment). you could argue that the law ought to be expanded to include such cases, but in that case you need to provide some argument for why it ought to do so. at the moment causing emotional distress is not grounds for a criminal conviction. why should it be in this type of case? and under what other circumstances should it be? if you are going to propose expanding the law to such situations, you must answer those questions at a minimum.",cq9cmdw,428.8113425538084,0,1428804290,231,25,1672,0,60.551816829579295,362.0,505.0,13.0,7,0.15384615384615385,0.0,0.38461538461538464,0.07692307692307693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07692307692307693,0.07692307692307693,0.0,0.7692307692307692,0.07309941520467836,0.22375690607734808,0.0,0,0.0,362,51.74,69.04,15.53,1.00,27.85,16.57,88.12,60.77,13.81,5.80,0.83,0.28,3.31,0.00,1.38,8.01,6.91,15.47,12.98,5.80,6.63,3.04,15.47,4.14,1.93,1.38,0.00,1.93,4.70,0.28,4.42,1.10,2.21,0.00,10.77,1.10,1.10,0.55,1.38,15.47,2.49,1.66,4.14,3.59,1.38,5.52,1.10,0.83,0.28,0.00,2.21,0.00,0.28,1.93,0.00,6.91,2.21,0.83,3.59,0.55,0.28,0.28,13.26,0.55,10.22,0.83,5.52,3.87,2.21,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.28,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.28,0.00,12.98,3.04,4.42,0.00,0.00,0.55,0.00,0.28,1.10,0.83,2.76,0.00

t3_334q3e,"politics is not on a pure left-right spectrum. there are lots of factors at play. low taxes are inherently liberal, since they maximize an individual's right to spend money as they wish. however, they are generally championed by conservatives. nowadays, we have an idea of what leftists support, and what rightwingers support, and we label that issue *edit as either ""liberal"" or ""conservative""*. perhaps pro gun views fall into conservative camp because of demographics. urban city dwellers probably have a more unfavorable view of guns (since they see lots of violent use of guns), urban city dwellers also tend to be mostly liberal. therefore liberals tend to be more anti gun. opposite for rural folk *edit who have more of a positive opinion and experience with guns*. specifically, the reason why leftists tend to favor gun control is they see it as a public safety issue. ""more guns in more hands leads to more deaths, either accidental or on purpose."" (more of an urban experience with guns) also, you will find most mainstream liberals are not for outright banning guns, but for stricter gun control laws (handguns and semi-automatics, magazine sizes, where you can carry them and what you need to carry them). if we are following the constitution to the letter, you should be able to own any firearm or explosive, since they all count as ""arms"". however, few people realistically support allowing private citizens owning hand grenades and rocket launchers, let alone nuclear weapons. it comes down to a balancing act of individual rights vs. the greater good. the amount of damage an individual can do with a nuclear weapon, for example, is much greater than the damage caused by taking away everyone's right to own nuclear weapons. where to draw the line comes into question. some people do not see owning a semi-automatic pistol with a 30 round magazine as justifable. others see it as an inherent right.",cqhioox,184.4707452428736,0,1429462077,62,12,2468,0,54.97062500000001,320.0,513.0,20.0,35,0.1,0.05,0.15,0.45,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05,0.05,0.05,0.0,0.05,0.0,0.0,0.9500000000000002,0.05277456461666988,0.309375,0.0,0,0.0,324,86.69,68.92,11.80,31.01,17.05,24.07,79.63,44.44,7.72,4.63,0.00,0.93,1.23,0.00,2.47,3.09,6.17,15.12,6.48,4.32,6.79,0.93,12.65,9.88,6.17,2.16,0.31,5.56,6.48,3.40,3.09,0.62,1.23,0.62,8.33,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,16.05,1.54,4.94,1.23,4.63,1.54,4.63,3.40,2.16,0.00,0.93,0.93,0.93,0.00,0.00,0.00,5.56,0.93,1.23,2.78,0.93,0.31,0.31,11.42,0.62,8.95,2.47,5.56,0.93,2.16,0.93,0.00,0.93,0.00,0.31,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,18.83,6.17,5.56,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.93,2.47,0.62,1.85,1.23

t3_39jwup,">a lot of the mra stuff i have seen is complaining on about militant feminists and not men's issues. if you are a feminist then this can be hard to wrap your head around. by your own admission you identify yourself as (what mras call) a ""dictionary feminist"". most mras are also ""dictionary feminists"" as are most all egalitarians and most of the western world. so why are most mras strong anti-feminists? feminisms are ideologies and/or philosophies that are way more than the dictionary definition. these philosophies (there are many) all share a few characteristics: 1. they cast gender issues as class a la marxism. 2. they believe in an unfalsifiable patriarchy thesis (not dictionary patriarchy). 3. they believe in post-structuralism or post-modernism. chances are you believe in the products of these philosophies even if you do not know anything about them. some products: 1. mansplaining 2. objectification. 3. manspreading. 4. denial that women can be sexist or bigots (power structure). 5. denial that men can be raped (power structure). 6. belief that rape is about male power or male entitlement. 7. belief that masculinity itself is oppressive. 8. over concern about words (post-modernism) 9. belief in rape culture. 10. demonization of (hetro) male sexuality. 11. duluth model of dv. 12. everything is a social construct. i really could go on and on. it simply does not follow that if you believe in the dictionary definition of feminism that you must believe in the philosophy....but in the real world that is what feminism is...not simply equality but a complex set of ideologies and philosophies with a plethora of corollary theories, all geared toward painting women as the oppressed and men as the oppressors. western popular culture accepts the feminist *narrative* without question, and this narrative denies men's issues unless men's issues are framed as by products of patriarchy or women's oppression. ""patriarchy hurts men too"". mras believe the narrative is incorrect and postulate a ""humanist counter theory"". the center piece of the counter theory is the idea of gynocentrism, male disposability and evolutionary (both biological and cultural) cooperation between the sexes. it is not a denial of the negative effects this has had on women (or men) but merely a new framework to look at gendered issues (or whether an issue is even gendered). unlike feminism though, there is not an overarching ideology...more an open market place of ideas that accepts scientific input and seeks how to best explain all the observations. post-modernism (feminism being post-modern) denies the validity of most gender based science. so there...big differences. but why are they so anti-feminist again? because the current feminist narrative does not allow for men to be worthy victims. gender as class marxism (feminism) dictates that men already have all the privilege, all the resources and thus their concerns (men's issues) are not really important. in fact, to even entertain helping them is misogynistic....like helping the 1%...helping the oppressor. mras rightly see the effects of this in policies and in the ""empathy gap"". as an example boys failing in education, loss of due process, duluth, etc etc...and the cause? feminism. of course many issues men face are not caused by feminism, but they are caused by gynocentrism and male disposability...things feminists deny exist or actively condone one way or the other. finally i want to note that they are not just complaining about ""militant feminists""...that's simply not true...they are complaining about feminism itself. feminism in whole is a problem...not just the so-called ""militants"". the ""militants"" are simply taking the bad ideology of feminism to it is logical conclusion. main stream feminists have a long history of publishing false and/or misleading data and lobbying against male victims of rape and dv. liberal media is entirely controlled by feminists despite feminist comprising a minority of liberals. these are not militant feminists...these are journalist, academics and major organizations. so arguing that it is the fringe crazy feminists is simply untrue. in closing being anti-feminist *is* being an activist for men issues...it is a necessary first step. and feminists are fighting tooth and nail. essentially they are competing narratives and whose narrative wins the cultural debate influences public and private policies. so even if you do not agree with the counter narrative i hope i have shown at least why anti-feminism is seen as a necessary component to the mrm. edit: i didn't add any links because that would just turn into a debate about the merits of the competing narratives and it is really too much information to sum up with a few links. i would have to link to the history of feminist thought, link to hours and hours of counter theory etc. so what instead i hope you consider is that you may not be taking the mrm seriously because you have not been properly exposed to the counter narrative and view gender issues through a feminist or gynocentric lens, even if you do not realize it. i know i did. i also thought feminism was just the dictionary definition...it's simply not true. someone else linked you to gww...she's really one of the best introductions to the counter narrative.",cs439f1,941.8238363091509,0,1434109054,95,29,15058,0,51.79501872292863,842.0,1443.0,85.0,0,0.047058823529411764,0.011764705882352941,0.07058823529411765,0.07058823529411765,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.011764705882352941,0.0,0.011764705882352941,0.011764705882352941,0.023529411764705882,0.2588235294117647,NaN,0.26009501187648454,0.0,0,0.0,884,62.74,53.17,28.18,25.77,12.63,26.24,77.04,49.66,9.16,4.30,1.24,0.00,1.70,0.11,1.24,4.86,7.58,11.20,8.82,6.00,8.26,2.49,12.22,4.07,2.60,1.02,2.15,3.17,4.75,2.38,2.38,0.00,0.68,0.34,9.28,0.00,0.00,0.57,2.71,16.74,4.07,2.38,1.47,3.85,1.58,6.45,0.79,0.57,0.00,0.23,1.36,0.34,0.34,0.57,0.00,5.09,0.45,0.90,3.73,0.68,0.57,1.02,10.29,0.45,7.35,0.57,4.75,1.47,2.49,0.11,0.00,0.11,0.34,0.00,0.11,0.00,0.00,0.11,0.00,0.00,22.85,12.90,1.47,0.34,0.00,0.34,0.00,1.13,1.81,1.02,2.94,0.90

[this article] (goes over the results of a study on the eating habits of a herd of cows, and how changes to their social groups effected how they eat. cows are both sentient and intelligent, and because of this, i agree with you. it is equally as horrible to eat a calf as it is to eat a fully grown cow.",cs5wfb8,329.1854484938859,0,1434259820,65,11,-16100,0,64.71081483644862,321.0,462.0,16.0,0,0.125,0.0,0.1875,0.4375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0625,0.0,0.8125,0.12233044733044734,0.24299065420560748,0.0,0,0.0,322,61.37,58.59,48.72,36.71,20.12,16.46,88.82,58.07,14.91,7.45,3.42,0.00,1.55,0.31,2.17,7.45,7.45,15.84,9.32,6.21,7.14,2.17,16.77,5.59,2.48,1.24,0.00,1.86,5.28,2.80,2.17,0.31,0.31,0.31,9.32,0.62,0.00,0.93,0.00,12.73,4.35,3.42,0.62,0.93,1.24,3.11,2.48,0.62,1.55,0.00,2.48,0.00,0.62,0.00,1.86,4.04,1.55,0.93,0.93,0.62,0.00,2.48,12.73,2.17,10.87,1.55,5.59,3.11,2.17,0.93,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.93,0.00,0.31,0.62,0.00,0.00,12.11,4.97,3.73,0.31,0.31,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.31,1.24,1.24

t3_2vxd18,"is your view that athletes aren't, say, as valuable to society as teachers, scientists, engineers, etc.? or is it that they should not get paid more than these people? if it is the former, then i somewhat agree, but if it is the latter then i disagree, so i will argue that first. people generally are not paid what they are worth to society. is a scientists who discovers a cure for cancer worth more to society than the ceo of mcdonalds? yeah probably, but i would assume that the ceo of mcdonalds is wealthier than someone who discovers the cure for cancer (although both probably make a good amount of money). a person who spends all their free time volunteering for charities is extremely valuable to society, but they do not get paid for their time and work when they volunteer. professional athletes get paid as much as they do because they generate billions of dollars for their employers. teachers, for example, do not generate the kind of revenue for their employers as athletes do, so they do not get paid nearly as much. as for athletes not being as valuable to society as other people, i somewhat disagree, but an argument can be made that they are valuable to society. first of all, they provide a lot of people with a ton of entertainment. it is hard to say how valuable entertainment is to society, but there is no denying that them being entertainers does provide some value to society. aside from that, professional athletes can bring economic impacts to the places they play and beyond as well. lets look at a baseball team for example. professional baseball teams play 162 games a year without including the playoffs. that's 81 home games a year. every home game a baseball team plays beings ~35,000 people to a certain part of a city. this means restaurant/bar owners get a bump in customers, privately run parking lots get a bump in customers, hotels get more people traveling to see a game, etc. there are also jobs that revolve around professional sports, like stadium security workers, food and beverage workers, field crews, stadium maintenance workers, sound technicians, camera/tv production crews, etc. these jobs and economic benefits would all be eliminated without professional athletes making their sports as popular as they are which gives them an economic value to society.",colq6cl,268.2155962828849,0,1423963353,49,14,2420,0,58.00701269035537,394.0,600.0,20.0,43,0.05,0.0,0.25,0.3,0.0,0.0,0.05,0.05,0.05,0.1,0.0,0.0,0.2,0.0,1.05,0.12519746335535806,0.22842639593908629,0.0,0,0.0,399,65.19,70.08,6.76,95.81,19.95,24.56,91.23,49.87,12.03,6.27,1.25,0.25,0.25,0.00,4.51,5.76,6.27,14.04,8.27,4.26,8.27,2.51,14.79,5.76,5.26,1.75,1.75,4.51,6.77,5.76,1.00,0.00,0.50,0.00,14.04,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,13.53,1.00,2.01,1.25,3.76,1.50,5.51,1.75,0.75,0.75,0.25,1.25,0.00,0.50,0.00,0.75,8.27,2.01,2.26,3.01,2.26,0.25,1.75,12.28,0.75,5.51,1.00,2.01,2.51,7.27,7.27,0.50,4.76,0.00,0.00,0.75,0.00,0.00,0.50,0.25,0.00,14.29,4.51,7.27,0.00,0.00,0.75,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.50,0.50,0.75

t3_30rmn6,"one important thing to know about reddit is that they value privacy of the user. according to their own privacy policy, the reddit admins cannot publicly discuss administrative actions taken against a user. what this means is that you will only ever hear one side of the story. users with a vendetta are free to make any claims they want and the admins will not and cannot respond. there are typically only a handful of things the admins will ban or shadow ban for: witch hunting and doxxing, ban evasion, vote manipulation, and a few other things. what this means is that if a user gets banned from reddit and gets upset, there is a easy strategy to raise a stink. make a new account to evade the ban, possibly using a new ip, then post something bad about reddit. then when their account is discovered to be an alt and they are banned again for legitimate reasons, it will look like reddit is censoring. and again, by their own privacy policy, they *cannot* talk about why they banned the person. even the users who are causing huge headaches for the admins have their right to privacy respected. this sort of thing is the source for much of the bad pr reddit gets. people are free to make any claim they want. when you only hear one side of the story it is very easy for the story teller to spin it however they want. also consider this from a staffing point of view. the employees of reddit are largely drawn from the reddit community itself. the community as a whole values openness and freedom of speech. when you hire from a group of people with those values, it would be very hard staff up a group of employees who would all be okay with censorship. if reddit itself was doing anything as unethical as suppressing information i have to believe that at least one of the seventy something employees would speak up about it. but none of them have. and even if every one of them was okay with censorship, if the admins started deleting threads the mods of those subreddits would know about it. covering that up requires an even larger conspiracy. plus, the reddit admins are *well* aware of the streisand effect. they know better than anyone that trying to remove content from the internet is doomed to fail. if they really wanted information to go away, they would just do nothing, let the controversy die on its own and be done with it. they wouldn't point a spotlight on it by removing it. that's a newbie mistake. i think it is far more likely that moderators are just acting on their own accord, following the rules of their own subreddits. for example, this very thread was removed for violating the rules (and then restored when the original post was made to comply with the rules). there was no conspiracy there, it was just regular ol enforcement of the rules.",cpv8s8x,259.3047997511274,0,1427694608,205,35,-18393,0,64.26419483101394,503.0,743.0,29.0,128,0.13793103448275862,0.0,0.06896551724137931,0.27586206896551724,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.034482758620689655,0.0,0.0,0.10344827586206896,0.0,0.6206896551724137,0.05616407402121687,0.220675944333996,0.0,0,0.0,503,67.57,64.73,5.01,51.83,17.34,15.71,86.68,56.66,13.12,4.77,0.40,0.00,0.60,0.00,3.78,8.35,8.95,14.31,9.74,6.76,6.16,1.59,16.10,3.98,1.79,1.79,1.19,2.39,4.97,3.18,1.79,0.20,0.20,0.40,8.35,0.00,0.00,0.20,0.00,13.12,2.78,2.39,3.18,3.38,0.80,3.18,1.99,0.60,0.80,0.40,0.20,0.00,0.20,0.00,0.00,7.95,0.80,0.80,4.77,1.19,1.19,2.19,10.93,1.39,7.95,1.59,3.38,2.58,2.19,2.19,0.00,0.80,0.20,0.20,2.58,0.00,1.99,0.40,0.20,0.00,11.13,5.77,3.58,0.20,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.40,0.40,0.80
t3_3d0d6p,"i am going to have a hard time citing evidence here, since my movie knowledge is practically zip (not my favorite medium, and i am woefully undereducated in terms of them), but speaking as a fan of fiction more generally: a twist is a plot device. it is in the same class as starting a movie [in medias res]((inception, for example) or throwing in a [deus ex machina](none of these things are inherently cheap - it is just that oftentimes, when a director pulls one of these out, he/she uses it cheaply. > basically my point is that it is a too simple way to make a movie 'smarter' and an overdone method of 'blowing peoples minds'. it depends on the twist, to be honest. i can imagine a movie which brilliantly deconstructs the idea of the twist that would be excellent and not cheap at all. say the twist happens in the first 20 minutes of the movie - [the character you thought was the main character gets killed off or something like that](- and the rest of the movie is about coping with that sudden twist. it turns from an action war movie or whatever to a drama about the character's family suffering from the grief of having their son/brother/father/husband (if the character is male, anyway) ripped away from them too soon. i wouldn't call this ""cheap"" at all - it could make for a really interesting discussion on death in wartime or a really great portrayal of a family in chaos, and could be done incredibly carefully and richly. remember, not every twist is made solely to surprise the audience. from what i understand about your post, i think you are complaining about the movies which are *all about twist* - that is, their entire purpose is to lead up to the twist ending which takes the audience's breath away. if you acknowledge that not every twist is this cheap - and that it is possible for a twist to be incredibly nuanced and totally alter the direction and tone of a movie - then i think you will find that your generalization is not necessarily true in all cases.",ct0njg0,1100.51148574029,0,1436713061,34,9,3940,0,48.25057618437903,355.0,528.0,11.0,9,0.0,0.0,0.09090909090909091,0.36363636363636365,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09090909090909091,0.09090909090909091,0.0,0.09090909090909091,0.18181818181818182,0.0,0.9090909090909092,0.1426414768806073,0.29577464788732394,0.0,0,0.0,363,76.32,51.10,44.11,35.39,33.00,16.80,86.50,57.58,13.77,6.06,2.75,0.00,1.65,0.55,1.10,7.71,10.19,14.60,9.09,4.96,5.51,1.93,17.36,3.03,1.38,1.65,0.83,2.48,3.86,2.20,1.65,0.00,0.55,0.83,7.16,1.65,0.00,0.28,1.65,14.05,3.03,2.20,1.65,3.03,2.75,3.86,0.83,0.00,0.55,0.28,0.28,0.28,0.00,0.00,0.00,5.23,1.10,1.10,2.20,0.83,0.28,1.10,10.47,1.10,12.67,4.13,5.51,2.75,1.10,3.31,0.55,1.10,0.00,1.10,0.55,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.28,17.08,3.03,3.31,0.28,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.93,0.55,1.93,2.48,3.58

t3_3ga0yc,"> between whistle blowers (william thomson, scott cooper, andrew wakefield etc) and corruption within the vaccine industry, it seems like something sinister is afoot. there are countless horror stories and it seems like everyone just shuts up about these things and keeps thumping that vaccines are the greatest. the problem with this argument is that it is open ended and not grounded in a fact or idea. it is as hard to dispute it as it is to dispute the comment *""i am scared""*. whistle-blowers are essential to keep groups honest. it does not mean that the whole system is better off gone. it only means that there are more flaws than an entity would otherwise acknowledge. i am not familiar with everyone on the list, but considering that obama immediately granted william thompson immunity from any crimes for testifying clearly indicates that we are not looking at a conspiracy. he spoke out and he was encouraged to do so. > now i am not antivaccine (although i have not been immunized yet) i am just not pro vaccine. i have not seen enough to discredit this dark side of things and show undoubtedly that vaccinations are the way to go. as /u/amazingmrbrock pointed out in what might be deemed *the laziest cmv comment in history* there is more at stake than what you can plainly see. specifically herd immunity. that means that we are communally protected from diseases because they are less prevalent. so for instance, babies younger than 1 year old or the elderly with weakened immune systems may not be able to be vaccinated. however the lack of prevalence of the disease in society makes it that they are still safe. so being vaccinated is not just about saving your life but it is about saving the lives of others around you. separately, it is important not to look at public policy from an empirical perspective. everyone will always know of a story about someone who suffered in some way. this only points out that a system is not perfect, which was never really in contention. the only question is if the system is better than the lack of a system. which *statistics* do a much better job at proving. looking at the [anti-vaccine body count](we can see staggering numbers in preventable diseases and deaths. if vaccines caused autism or had similar effects, then surely it would be measurable in a similar way. we could reconcile that data against each other. but in the absence of facts, horror stories take it is place. i can see how gory details are more moving than a chart, but it does not make them more accurate.",ctw8bfs,359.74833767659607,0,1439070319,26,11,-23857,0,60.13046568012709,443.0,681.0,27.0,32,0.037037037037037035,0.037037037037037035,0.25925925925925924,0.2222222222222222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07407407407407407,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.07407407407407407,0.0,0.037037037037037035,0.0,0.7777777777777779,0.01730769230769231,0.26636568848758463,0.0,0,0.0,448,46.71,35.21,46.90,29.50,16.59,22.77,83.93,57.81,14.29,4.46,1.56,0.89,0.89,0.45,0.67,9.82,6.03,13.62,11.61,6.03,6.25,3.12,17.63,6.92,5.13,1.34,0.22,2.46,4.24,2.23,2.01,0.67,0.45,0.22,6.92,0.22,0.00,0.00,0.45,17.86,3.12,1.34,1.79,3.12,3.35,7.81,2.46,2.01,0.22,0.22,2.46,0.22,2.23,0.00,0.00,5.80,1.79,1.12,1.12,1.12,1.34,2.23,14.06,0.89,10.27,0.67,6.70,2.90,0.67,0.00,0.00,0.45,0.00,0.22,0.22,0.00,0.22,0.00,0.00,0.00,12.95,6.03,2.23,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.45,0.45,0.00,1.12,2.68

t3_35y0qf,"semantics are precisely about precise meaning, nuance and content. to dismiss an argument with ""it's just about semantics"" is literally to say ""actual meaning of a statement does not matter to me."" meaning is absolutely the single most important thing in any communication. so, if you are saying that a well thought out and well expressed cmv is easier to argue for and/or against than a cmv that is not well thought out and well expressed -- i agree. but, if you are saying that nuances in meaning do not matter to a v in order to evaluate it properly, then i could not disagree more. one of the reasons that more and more people are support gay rights is because the semantic discussion around what rights straight people posses that are systematically denied to gay people, opinions start to change. when you start pointing out what rights gays are denied, people's views change. when you explain that gay people can be fired for being gay; that they can be denied inheritance from their life partners by estranged family; the right to have a say in the health care of their life partner and on for 6,000 some various bits of law and regulation tied to the definition of marriage; people who oppose gay marriage will generally still come down on the side of ""yes -- that stuff sucks, and we should do something about that."" at that point, the conversation can become focused on the reality that we can either spend billions of dollars to systematically change thousands of laws and regulations across every city, county, metro area and state. or we can pass a single law giving marriage rights to gays and fix the majority of issues. and it becomes clear that the opposition is not one about rights at all, but about a particular theocratic understanding of marriage, that puts them in opposition to gay rights. but that's a great thing, because then those who are arguing for gay rights can actually have a conversation with the person arguing against them on the actual substance and content of their opposition. semantics is critical to actually discovering the issue of debate. to dismiss an argument as to being just about semantics is to say that one can meaningfully argue against an imprecise and ambiguous statement.",cr8vi2j,298.1637549451739,0,1431615670,90,15,1190,0,51.43406250000001,384.0,579.0,14.0,19,0.21428571428571427,0.0,0.2857142857142857,0.07142857142857142,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07142857142857142,0.0,0.0,0.07142857142857142,0.14285714285714285,0.0,0.857142857142857,0.13926443926443927,0.23958333333333334,0.0,0,0.0,387,73.69,76.53,36.07,30.11,27.64,21.96,88.11,55.30,11.11,4.13,0.78,0.78,1.03,0.00,1.55,6.98,6.72,16.80,9.82,5.43,7.49,1.29,13.44,5.68,2.58,1.55,2.33,3.62,5.43,2.84,2.58,0.00,2.07,0.00,12.66,1.29,0.52,0.00,0.00,14.21,4.39,1.55,1.03,2.58,1.55,4.91,1.81,0.52,1.29,0.00,3.62,0.00,0.78,2.33,0.52,7.49,3.36,0.00,3.88,0.26,0.00,0.78,11.89,0.78,9.82,1.55,6.20,1.81,1.55,0.78,0.26,0.78,0.00,0.00,2.07,0.26,0.00,0.78,1.03,0.00,11.63,3.62,3.62,0.00,0.78,0.00,0.00,1.03,1.55,0.78,0.00,0.26

t3_3h3y3p,"is death always bad? some consider euthanasia to be a mercy because it grants the individual's wish to end their suffering. many depressed people attempt suicide in order to escape the pain of living. it seems that, at least for some, suffering is the real enemy and not death. suffering defined as, ""to undergo (something painful or unpleasant, as injury, grief, a loss, etc.)"", (webster's new world college dictionary, 5th edition) would encompass unwanted pregnancies. this would also include unwanted pregnancies even if they were termed as only ""inconveniences"", an extremely mild form of suffering (perhaps just above what qualifies merely as discomfort). i think ""inconvenience"" severely downplays the mental and physical stress women undergo throughout their pregnancies. there's no doubt that these women are well-aware of the suffering of pregnancy, especially the emotional toll it takes when they have no desire to carry the child. what perception of suffering can infant have? all of the physical ones, probably, once the nocioceptors have fully developed (latest estimates seem to be 20 weeks). fetuses show physiological responses to pain around 18 to 20 weeks. perhaps the safest course would be to anesthetize them for abortion to ensure there is no physical suffering for the unborn. there is still the matter of suffering due to non-physical origins - maybe call it ""emotional suffering"", as from grief, distress, etc. i have my own opinions, of course, but consider your own: do you believe a fetus is sufficiently cognitively developed to suffer psychological distress at the thought of the cessation of its own existence? if an individual is unaware of its impending death, taken completely by surprise, was there suffering in its death? scientifically, the only suffering in an individual's death is that which is experienced by those who are still aware beyond it. so, one might argue an abortion is immoral on these grounds: it induces suffering in those who oppose it. perhaps the opposition is the other parent; perhaps it is the grandparents, the friends, the community, the country, or even the whole world. thus arises the argument of bodily autonomy, rooted deeply in free will. the world vs. the woman: whose suffering is more important? if we deem abortion as immoral without regard to the woman's wishes, then she must endure suffering as we override her free will. (if one questions, ""what about the wishes of the fetus? what about his/her free will?"", then we return to questioning what suffering a minimally thinking and minimally perceiving individual can experience about a concept it lacks the cognitive resources to imagine.) the specific definition of free will is another discussion altogether, so i hope a general one founded in common understanding will suffice for our purposes. so, consider this, if you would: suppose we undertake all necessary efforts to ensure the absence of suffering in the soon-to-be-dead, the continuation of its existence would depend wholly upon the woman's health and life at the cost of inflicting unavoidable and unwanted suffering to her, and forbidding her to avoid her personal suffering would be an imposition of our will by violating her free will. what do you think of this situation? tl;dr what measure is a life?",cu44cop,167.39834166659665,0,1439669039,43,7,8719,0,44.28577272727273,528.0,903.0,30.0,0,0.03333333333333333,0.03333333333333333,0.1,0.4666666666666667,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.0,0.03333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1,0.0,0.7999999999999999,0.0733318405732199,0.29924242424242425,0.0,0,0.0,538,74.80,78.25,2.42,1.00,19.93,27.51,87.92,52.23,11.90,5.02,0.74,1.12,0.74,1.49,0.93,6.88,8.74,13.57,8.74,6.51,5.39,0.93,15.99,6.13,2.04,2.23,1.30,1.67,10.41,2.04,8.18,1.12,0.74,4.28,9.67,1.12,0.19,2.23,0.37,14.68,3.90,1.67,3.90,4.65,2.23,2.04,1.49,0.19,0.00,0.56,3.90,0.37,3.72,1.30,0.00,5.95,1.67,0.74,1.86,0.56,1.86,0.74,8.55,2.97,7.81,0.37,4.28,2.79,2.04,0.00,0.00,1.12,0.56,1.67,0.19,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.19,0.00,19.33,3.90,6.51,0.74,0.37,1.67,0.00,1.12,1.86,1.12,1.86,0.19

(for the record, i do not believe that to be true, but i have not studied the issue). on top of that, he stated that while he believe many of them were degenerates of some level, he also flatly stated that he assumed some of them were good people. like i said, i can't comment on the military interventionalism and billionaire allegations, but if you have bought into such a misleading characterization of trump's mexican comments, it wouldn't surprise me if you have been equally mislead on the other issues as well.",ctdllai,289.6140164614002,0,1437677804,22,5,2401,0,41.75000000000003,205.0,328.0,7.0,5,0.14285714285714285,0.0,0.42857142857142855,0.14285714285714285,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.14285714285714285,0.0,0.857142857142857,0.0638401559454191,0.25365853658536586,0.0,0,0.0,208,56.33,51.92,26.92,62.24,29.71,21.63,82.21,55.29,16.35,9.62,3.85,0.96,1.44,2.40,0.96,6.73,7.21,13.46,8.17,3.85,7.21,3.37,15.38,4.33,3.37,0.96,1.44,3.37,2.40,1.92,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,10.58,0.00,0.48,0.00,2.40,15.38,2.88,1.44,2.40,4.33,1.92,5.29,0.96,0.00,0.96,0.00,0.48,0.00,0.48,0.00,0.00,5.29,1.44,0.48,3.37,0.48,0.00,4.81,10.58,0.00,10.10,0.96,6.25,2.88,2.88,0.00,0.00,1.44,0.00,0.00,0.48,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.48,0.00,17.31,3.37,4.81,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.96,0.96,1.92,1.92,3.37

t3_39xc0u,"let us unpack your reasoning. you wrote: >the reason i want to abolish rent regulations in nyc is that it drastically reduces the available housing supply and harms people looking to move to or within the city. anyone who has won the rent regulation lottery never moves out, and you end up with a highly inefficient allocation of apartments within the city. >it also hugely depresses the creation of new rental units within the city, because new landlords see what happened to old landlords who got stuck with controlled units. this contains the following assertions: 1. rent control reduces the available housing supply 2. rent control harms people looking to move to or within the city 3. rent control leads to a highly inefficient allocation of apartments 4. rent control depresses the creation of new rental units. let's go in order. 1. rent control does nothing to change the short-run supply of housing, except in the scenario where maintenance on an occupied property costs more than just leaving it alone. yet, according to new york city local law 30 of 1970, the formula which sets the rent levels reflects real estate taxes, water and sewer charges, operating and maintenance expenses, return on capital value and vacancy and collection loss allowance. there is no scenario where this is plausible. (except for your point 4, which we will address later). 2. rent control **does** harm people looking to move to the city. absolutely. but rent control regulations are the result of a democratic process in which the residents of an area chose the laws that would govern them. no one outside the city has the absolute right to move to the city and pay comparable rents as existing residents. do not think this is fair? well, in the united states, we do not let immigrants enter unless they promise to pay taxes and not get government benefits. this is because, people who live outside the united states **are not entitled** to the benefits of living here. similarly, people who live outside of nyc **are not entitled** to move here without paying the rent. 3. rent control does lead to an economically inefficient allocation of apartments. but there is no *a priori* reason to assume that efficiency is the paramount social goal. **equity** is as important, or more important, to many people. this is a normative argument, and there is simply no way to empirically prove that trading efficiency for equity is better or worse. it is simply about the values of residents in this city. 4. **rent control does not depress the creation of new units. new construction is not subject to rent control.** except in the case that the new builder accepts large property tax incentives in exchange for applying rent control, which is a freely made business decision. for example, the economist anthony downs wrote that ""repeated studies of temperate rent controls in the united states provide no persuasive evidence that such controls significantly reduce new construction here."" here are some other citations. michael j. mandel, does rent control hurt tenants?: a reply to epstein, brooklyn law review, vol. 54, pages 1267-1274 phillip weitzman, economics and rent regulation: a call for a new perspective, new york university review of law and social change, vol. 13, pages 975-988 john cirace, housing market instability and rent stabilization, brooklyn law review, vol. 54 pages 1275 - 1280.",cs7on09,1545.1943090381753,0,1434409904,142,19,-2302,0,54.7338914373089,545.0,895.0,42.0,4,0.047619047619047616,0.0,0.09523809523809523,0.2857142857142857,0.0,0.0,0.09523809523809523,0.0,0.0,0.023809523809523808,0.023809523809523808,0.0,0.023809523809523808,0.0,0.5952380952380952,0.07177521522836029,0.26605504587155965,0.0,0,0.0,566,90.95,50.00,35.23,45.23,14.15,25.09,80.39,42.23,6.89,1.94,0.18,0.71,0.71,0.00,0.35,4.95,7.95,12.90,5.48,3.36,4.24,2.65,11.31,4.24,1.77,1.94,3.71,0.71,4.95,3.00,1.94,0.00,0.18,1.06,4.95,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,12.01,2.12,5.30,0.35,1.24,1.06,3.53,0.88,0.71,0.00,0.18,0.88,0.00,0.71,0.00,0.18,10.42,1.06,2.12,6.54,1.24,0.53,1.24,8.30,0.18,13.25,2.65,7.42,3.00,6.71,0.00,6.36,7.07,0.00,0.00,0.35,0.00,0.00,0.18,0.18,0.00,19.08,7.07,5.12,0.71,0.00,0.35,0.00,0.71,0.35,0.18,0.35,4.24

t3_361st8,"looking at some of your comments, it just sounds like you are not attracted to people wearing revealing clothing. that's not really a bad thing, nor can you really help that. however, you also can't blame a girlfriend for doing so. you can choose not to be in a relationship with her, but you do not have the right to blame her or try to stop her. if she does not feel the same way about the sanctity of her body, that's not something you have the right to be upset about. if you happen to start a relationship in the winter with a girl who's quite well-dressed, and you find that she has the opposite during the summer, you are perfectly within your rights to tell her about it, and even end the relationship due to your discomfort, but you are not within your rights to give her shit about it. that being said, there sounds like there is some form of spirituality or romanticism in your view. as in, you view your body and her body as something more than just a body. that's also well within your rights to believe that, but if you are not a very religious person, you should come to terms with the fact that all you are seeing is a conglomeration of fat, muscle, bone, glands and skin that happens to spark a reaction in the conglomeration of neurons and fat inside your skull that sends chemicals to your glands that eventually makes you come to the conclusion that you like what you see and you would like to do things with what you see. yeah, that's a bit of a simplistic way of thinking about it, but from a purely scientific point, there is nothing to be said of nudity or modesty. if you are uncomfortable with almost an identical reaction also happening inside the skulls of other men, whatever, but just keep in mind that almost the exact same reaction happens in their skulls when they see other women as well, and the same truth applies to you. there are very few differences between your reaction to your hypothetical girlfriend and your reaction to nearly any girl in immediate proximity with a similar level of attractiveness and state of clothing. there is no magical connection, just a bunch of chemicals that make you want each other, and a bunch of chemicals that make you really want to stop other people from having that exact same reaction, because evolution tells you that if her and other males have the same reactions that you and her have, you will not have as high of a chance as passing on your genetic material. people think it is purely a cultural thing - it is not. jealousy is a biological thing, and modesty is just a response to a male-dominated culture that experiences and indulges in unbridled jealousy.",cradyw7,245.31484928599448,0,1431725807,188,56,33003,0,54.17063354037269,483.0,685.0,15.0,1,0.2,0.0,0.4,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.4666666666666668,0.06444077631052421,0.2028985507246377,0.0,0,0.0,485,44.40,91.63,10.91,22.57,32.33,16.08,94.85,63.92,19.18,10.72,0.00,0.00,8.04,2.27,0.41,8.45,7.42,15.46,8.04,7.01,8.25,2.89,14.64,4.33,3.51,1.03,0.00,2.06,3.92,1.86,2.06,0.62,1.24,0.00,16.49,0.00,0.41,2.89,0.62,16.91,1.65,2.47,1.86,4.12,1.86,7.63,3.09,1.65,0.82,0.41,3.92,3.30,1.03,0.21,0.41,2.89,1.44,0.62,0.62,0.21,0.62,0.62,12.37,0.41,8.45,0.82,5.15,2.47,0.82,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.41,0.00,1.03,0.21,0.00,0.21,0.62,0.00,10.52,3.09,5.57,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.62,0.00,1.24,0.00,0.00

t3_31p2g2,"colorblindness in practice (how i am referring to what you are proposing) has no way of redressing the serious damages that persist today as a result of racism. for example, a college admissions committee who ignores race (particularly with respect to college admissions) ignores the fact that black applicants are much more likely to have lower academic preparation due to racist policies that persisted through the 20th century (segregation, redlining, housing covenants). in that case, colorblindness yields the same result as considerable anti-black bias. also, to frame racism as solely existing in interpersonal actions is to misunderstand the history of the us. it is my pet theory (and i am still working on it) that racism **is** the history of the us - particularly when you consider the economic rationale of the civil war. while states' rights is a nominal reason, it is much more important to understand that cotton (a product that was based on the forced subjugation and theft of the labor of slaves) was 60% of american exports in the mid 19th century. that economic reality (that american economic success is only possible via slavery) manifests itself in the social fabric as well - that is how you get characterizations of blacks as subhuman (sambo, jezebel, the angry negro) that translate into modern day stereotypes. my argument is that racism is as central to america as ""taxation without representation"" or any other quintessentially ""american"" thing - many of the founders of this country have a poor track record with respect to slaves and slavery. in my opinion, you can't ignore racism any more than you can ignore the constitution - to do so is to invalidate the lived realities of a traditionally/historically invalidated people.",cq3oxs7,192.98107605108152,0,1428402805,117,18,5189,0,23.831666666666706,282.0,504.0,9.0,0,0.1111111111111111,0.1111111111111111,0.1111111111111111,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.2222222222222222,0.0,0.2222222222222222,0.0,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.1111111111111111,0.1111111111111111,0.0,1.4444444444444446,0.04864316239316239,0.36879432624113473,0.0,0,0.0,285,86.73,58.33,17.69,4.46,31.67,28.77,80.35,49.47,11.58,4.21,1.75,0.70,1.75,0.00,0.00,7.37,8.42,16.14,7.37,3.51,5.96,1.05,10.53,6.32,4.56,1.75,0.35,2.81,5.61,1.75,3.86,0.00,1.05,0.35,4.21,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,9.47,2.11,3.16,0.00,2.46,1.05,1.75,1.40,1.40,0.00,0.00,0.35,0.00,0.35,0.00,0.00,8.42,1.40,2.11,4.21,0.70,0.35,1.05,10.18,0.35,9.82,0.35,5.26,4.21,5.26,0.00,0.70,1.75,0.00,0.35,0.35,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.35,0.00,17.19,3.16,3.16,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,1.75,1.40,0.70,4.91,2.11

t3_36adfo,"this is quite a broad cmv claim. what problems does ""most all"" cover? in general, solving problems is not as simple as throwing more money at them. increasing public funding to post-secondary institutions will not solve the problems that are endemic in the primary and secondary education system, for example. unequal and non-redistributive funding schemes, poor attitudes in much of the country towards education, and a lack of money for schools are issues that impact education far more than student debt. certainly student debt is an issue, and it would be nice if schools in the states received more public funding, but the bigger issues here are systemic and attitudinal, and not necessarily just fiscal. i would argue that, in fact, many problems in the us are not inherently fiscal matters as much as they are infrastructural ones, that are themselves brought about by attitudinal problems that are resistant to change. the american notion of 'liberty' for example makes it difficult to pass legislation that redistributes wealth from the rich to the poor, because doing so is perceived as ""robbing the rich"". *if these people were successful, why should they be punished for being so through higher taxation?* this attitude of ""each person earns what they deserve and deserves what they earn"" makes it difficult to pass any sort of significant structural reforms that would improve healthcare or education for the poor. what is worse, this attitude even extends to the poor themselves, with many supporters for us republicans being fairly poor themselves. **tl;dr:** throwing money at education and healthcare will not create any significant changes to the country, because the infrastructure in place perpetuates inequality, and these structures themselves can't be changed without an overhaul of social ideology that shies away from maximizing the potential of individual success and focuses more on the maximization of the social well being.",crcc5ao,61.48107922989969,0,1431904699,147,12,11494,0,37.33997311827957,310.0,525.0,12.0,4,0.0,0.0,0.25,0.16666666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16666666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5833333333333333,0.0806096681096681,0.2967741935483871,0.0,0,0.0,313,78.23,51.28,4.08,12.93,28.45,30.03,81.47,49.52,10.22,3.83,0.32,0.64,0.00,0.00,2.88,6.39,6.71,14.70,8.63,2.56,7.35,2.24,12.14,9.27,4.47,1.60,0.00,4.47,8.63,3.83,4.79,0.00,0.64,0.00,6.39,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.00,14.70,0.96,3.51,3.83,3.19,1.28,4.15,0.32,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.32,0.00,0.32,0.00,0.00,13.42,1.28,2.88,6.39,1.28,2.88,0.96,7.99,0.96,8.95,2.56,6.07,0.32,4.79,0.00,0.00,5.43,0.00,0.00,0.32,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.32,0.00,15.02,3.19,5.11,0.32,0.32,0.64,0.00,0.64,1.92,0.96,0.00,1.92

t3_301n6h,"point 1: this is essentially the ""but i have a black friend"" excuse. the statement itself is riddled with that annoying ""but i am 1/16th cherokee and i say it is not offensive"" argument. it is left vague, leading me to believe that they do not have anybody who is outright native but instead oh so-and-so has some heritage. also, the ""i lived with them for a year"" type excuse seems really dismissive, like they lived there for a year and now they are qualified to talk about native interests? it seems strange that they would be so eager to pride themselves on hiring non-white people behind the scenes, but apparently do not care enough to hire them to play people meant to be their race? it would be one thing if it was just some random character with no given cultural association, but asking a non-native person to play a native character is a rampant form of erasure in american media. point 2: honestly, writing a show around these two just seems lazy in its own. if they were so committed to having jane krakowski where she is, then they should have just left her ethnicity open-ended or not discussed it instead of outright having her play a definitively native character. 2b: this harkens back to the weird act of hiring native people to play things that are less important and visible, instead of allowing a native person to play a leading role meant for a native person. 3: their commitment to research is the only thing keeping the portrayal from being offensive, so touting it proudly seems rather pathetic. i would like to think that writers research literally everything they write about, so boasting that they researched lakota culture should not be some unusual circumstance worthy of being put on a pedestal, it should be normal. all in all, i would say it is not the most offensive thing ever since they did they research, but it is just another opportunity for native actors to get into the spotlight and instead the mainstream media chooses white actors again and again. considering the lengths a show would go to portray things accurately, it seems to be a cheap shortcut to just lazily cast another well known white actor in a role that is explicitly intended to be native.",cpoikva,1142.9845079502752,0,1427157383,104,16,-10165,0,50.01647867676367,386.0,578.0,13.0,0,0.23076923076923078,0.0,0.8461538461538461,0.23076923076923078,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.07692307692307693,0.07692307692307693,0.07692307692307693,1.5384615384615383,0.043087121212121215,0.24870466321243523,0.0,0,0.0,395,42.10,55.02,11.92,54.37,30.38,19.49,85.06,56.20,14.68,6.33,1.77,0.00,0.00,0.76,3.80,8.35,6.58,11.14,10.63,8.10,5.82,1.77,17.97,3.29,0.76,0.51,1.52,2.28,6.08,3.80,2.28,0.00,1.27,0.25,10.13,0.00,0.25,0.76,0.00,16.46,3.29,1.27,3.04,4.05,2.28,5.32,2.28,1.77,0.51,0.00,0.51,0.00,0.51,0.00,0.00,3.54,0.51,1.52,1.52,0.76,0.00,3.04,10.89,0.25,7.34,1.01,4.05,2.53,3.54,2.03,0.00,0.25,0.00,0.00,0.51,0.00,0.00,0.00,0.51,0.00,10.89,2.78,3.54,1.01,0.00,0.51,0.00,1.27,1.52,0.00,0.00,0.25
